   Never mine eyes saw sunlight pierce the gloom,
   Only ye, brother angels, used to sweep
   Down from your heaven, and visit me in sleep.
   'Neath blood-red hands my young life withered there.
     Dear Lord, the bad are miserable all,
   Be not Thou deaf, like them, unto my prayer,
     It is for them I call."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The angels sang: "See heaven's high arch unfold,
     Come, we will crown thee with the stars above,
   Will give thee cherub-wings of blue and gold,
     And thou shalt learn our ministry of love,
   Shalt rock the cradle where some mother's tears
     Are dropping o'er her restless little one,
   Or, with thy luminous breath, in distant spheres,
     Shalt kindle some cold sun."</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
