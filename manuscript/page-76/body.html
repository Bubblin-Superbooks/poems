       Turned aside by the wand of a fairy?
   Wilt thou teach us spell-words that protect from all harm,
       And thoughts of evil banish?
   What goblins the sign of the cross may disarm?
   What saint it is good to invoke? and what charm
       Can make the demon vanish?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Or unfold to our gaze thy most wonderful book,
       So feared by hell and Satan;
   At its hermits and martyrs in gold let us look,
   At the virgins, and bishops with pastoral crook,
       And the hymns and the prayers in Latin.
   Oft with legends of angels, who watch o'er the young,
       Thy voice was wont to gladden;
   Have thy lips yet no languageâ€”no wisdom thy tongue?
   Oh, see! the light wavers, and sinking, bath flung
       On the wall forms that sadden.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
