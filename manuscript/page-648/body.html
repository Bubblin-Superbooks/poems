   Next morning, this is what was viewed in town:
   Dawn coming—people going—some adown
   Praying, some crying; pallid cheeks, swift feet,
   And a huge lion stalking through the street.

   Solicitous to live, holding his breath
   Specially precious to the realm. Now death
   Is not thus viewed by honest beasts of prey;
