                             Honest Man—
   Priest Pius? No! Each does but what he can.
   Yonder's the criminal! The warlike wight
   Who hides behind the ranks of France to fight,
   Greek Sinon's blood crossed thick with Judas-Jew's,
   The Traitor who with smile which true men woos,
   Lip mouthing pledges—hand grasping the knife—
   Waylaid French Liberty, and took her life.
   Kings, he is of you! fit companion! one
   Whom day by day the lightning looks upon
   Keen; while the sentenced man triples his guard
   And trembles; for his hour approaches hard.
   Ye ask me "when?" I say <em>soon</em>! Hear ye not
   Yon muttering in the skies above the spot?
   Mark ye no coming shadow, Kings? the shroud
   Of a great storm driving the thunder-cloud?
   Hark! like the thief-catcher who pulls the pin,
   God's thunder asks to <em>speak to one within</em>!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
