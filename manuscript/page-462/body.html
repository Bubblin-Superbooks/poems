   Good but most terrible.  In the dread scale
   Which princes weighted with their horrid tale
   Of craft and violence, and blood and ill,
   And fire and shocking deeds, his sword was still
   God's counterpoise displayed. Ever alert
   More evil from the wretched to avert,
   Those hapless ones who 'neath Heaven's vault at night
   Raise suppliant hands. His lance loved not the plight
   Of mouldering in the rack, of no avail,
   His battle-axe slipped from supporting nail
   Quite easily; 'twas ill for action base
   To come so near that he the thing could trace.
   The steel-clad champion death drops all around
   As glaciers water. Hero ever found
   Eviradnus is kinsman of the race
   Of Amadys of Gaul, and knights of Thrace,
   He smiles at age. For he who never asked
   For quarter from mankindâ€”shall he be tasked
   To beg of Time for mercy? Rather he
   Would girdle up his loins, like Baldwin be.
   Aged he is, but of a lineage</blockquote></div> </div>
