               Before the court,
   And held it were to win a kiss his duty
               To give a fort,
   Or, more, to sign away all bright Dorado,

             Without her nigh;
   I'm but a hound to follow her, and only
             At her feet die.
   I'd gayly spend of toilsome years a dozen—
             A felon styled—
   Oh! this chill wind, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "One summer day when long—so long? I'd missed her,
             She came anew,
   To play i' the fount alone but for her sister,
             And bared to view
   The finest, rosiest, most tempting ankle,
             Like that of child—
   Oh! this chill wind, etc.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
