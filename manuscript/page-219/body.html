     Then more nights, and still days, steps of Time in his flight.

     O'er the face of the hills, o'er the face of the seas,
   O'er streamlets of silver, and forests that ring
     With a dirge for the dead, chanted low by the breeze;
   The face of the waters, the brow of the mounts
   Deep scarred but not shrivelled, and woods tufted</blockquote></div> </div>
