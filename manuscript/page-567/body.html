<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Thus is it with kings' children, for they wear
   A shadowy circlet on their forehead fair;
   Their tottering steps are towards a kingly chair.
   Calmly she waits, and breathes her gathered flower
   Till one shall cull for her imperial power.
   Already her eye saith, "It is my right;"
   Even love flows from her, mingled with affright.
   If some one seeing her so fragile stand,
   Were it to save her, should put forth his hand,
   Ere he had made a step, or breathed a vow,
   The scaffold's shadow were upon his brow.
   While the child laughs, beyond the bastion thick
   Of that vast palace, Roman Catholic,
   Whose every turret like a mitre shows,
   Behind the lattice something dreadful goes.
   Men shake to see a shadow from beneath
   Passing from pane to pane, like vapory wreath,
   Pale, black, and still it glides from room to room;
   In the same spot, like ghost upon a tomb;
   Or glues its dark brown to the casement wan,
   Dim shade</blockquote></div> </div>
