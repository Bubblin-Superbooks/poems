</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {July, 1871.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I feel thy presence, Charles. Sweet martyr! down
         In earth, where men decay,
   I search, and see from cracks which rend thy tomb,
         Burst out pale morning's ray.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Close linked are bier and cradle: here the dead,
         To charm us, live again:
   Kneeling, I mourn, when on my threshold sounds
         Two little children's strain.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
