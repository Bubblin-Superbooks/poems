</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {LAUS PUER: POEM V.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Take heed of this small child of earth;
     He is great: in him is God most high.
   Children before their fleshly birth
     Are lights in the blue sky.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In our brief bitter world of wrong
     They come; God gives us them awhile.
   His speech is in their stammering tongue,
     And His forgiveness in their smile.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
