     Doth, in this mortal state,
   Its tone, its fragrance, or its glow
     Communicate;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Since all that lives and moves
     Upon the earth, bestows
   On what it seeks and what it loves
     Its thorn or rose;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Since April to the trees
     Gives a bewitching sound,
   And sombre night to grief gives ease,
     And peace profound;</p></blockquote></div> </div>
