       Some secret sorrow damps
   There's a cloud on your brow. What has happened? Oh, say,
   For your eyeballs glare out with a sinister ray
       Like the light of funeral lamps.
   And the blades of your poniards are half unsheathed
       In your beltâ€”and ye frown on me!
   There's a woe untold, there's a pang unbreathed
       In your bosom, my brothers three!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   ELDEST BROTHER.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Gulnara, make answer! Hast thou, since the dawn,
   To the eye of a stranger thy veil withdrawn?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE SISTER.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
