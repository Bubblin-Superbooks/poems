     The Commander of Believers, a Bashaw
   Whose very robes were from Asia's greatest stript,
     More powerful than any lion with resistless paw)
   A master weighed on by his immense splendor—
     Once had a dream when he was at his evening feast,
   When the broad table smoked like a perfumed censer,
     And its grateful odors the appetite increased.
   The banquet was outspread in a hall, high as vast,
     With pillars painted, and with ceiling bright with gold,
   Upreared by Zim's ancestors in the days long past,
     And added to till now worth a sum untold.
