   Bowed the fair face, still wet with many a tear,
   In depths of space, the rolling worlds were stayed,
   Whilst the Eternal in the infinite said:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "O king, I kept thee far from human state,
     Who hadst a dungeon only for thy throne,
   O son, rejoice, and bless thy bitter fate,
     The slavery of kings thou hast not known,
   What if thy wasted arms are bleeding yet,
     And wounded with the fetter's cruel trace,
   No earthly diadem has ever set
     A stain upon thy face.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   "Child, life and hope were with thee at thy birth,
   But life soon bowed thy tender form to earth,
     And hope forsook thee in thy hour of need.
   Come, for thy Saviour</blockquote></div> </div>
