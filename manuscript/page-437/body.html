</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Bk. II. vi.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   At work within his barn since very early,
     Fairly tired out with toiling all the day,
     Upon the small bed where he always lay
   Boaz was sleeping by his sacks of barley.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Barley and wheat-fields he possessed, and well,
     Though rich, loved justice; wherefore all the flood
     That turned his mill-wheels was unstained with mud
   And in his smithy blazed no fire of hell.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
