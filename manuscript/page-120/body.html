     Uncontrolled, see it pass!
       Horrid idols all twist,
       By the crumbling flame kissed
   In their infamous dread,
     Shrivelled members of brass!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   It grows angry, flows on,
   Silver towers fall down
   Unforeseen, like a dream
   In its green and red stream,
   Which lights up the walls
   Ere one crashes and falls,
   Like the changeable scale
   Of a lizard's bright mail.
   Agate, porphyry, cracks
   And is melted to wax!
   Bend low to their doom
   These stones of the tomb!
   E'en the great marble giant
   Called Nabo, sways pliant
   Like a tree; whilst the flare
     Seemed each column to scorch
     As it blazed like a torch
   Round and round in the air.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   The magi, in vain,
