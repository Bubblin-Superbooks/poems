   Who makes the seed expand beneath the mountain's weight;
   Who for a swallow's nest leaves one old castle wall,
   Who lets for famished beetles savory apples fall,
   Who bids a pigmy win where Titans fail, in yoke,
   And, in what we deem fruitless roar and smoke,
   Makes Etna, Chimborazo, still His praises sing,
   And saves a city by a word lapped 'neath a pigeon's wing!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
