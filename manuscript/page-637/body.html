<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Hath any done—nay, only half performed—
         The good he might for others?
   Hath any conquered hatred, or had strength
         To treat his foes like brothers?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   E'en he, who's tried his best, hath evil wrought:
         Pain springs from happiness:
   My heart has triumphed in defeat, my pulse
         Ne'er quickened at success.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I seemed the greater when I felt the blow:
         The prick gives sense of gain;
   Since to make others bleed my courage fails,
         I'd rather bear the pain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To grow is sad, since evils grow no less;
         Great height is mark for all:
   The more I have of branches, more of clustering boughs,
         The ghastlier shadows fall.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
