   On which to lay the head, lulled by the praise
   Of thousand fluttering fans of flatterers!
   Wearied of war-horse, gratefully one glides
   In gilded barge, or in crowned, velvet car,
   From gay Whitehall to gloomy Temple Bar—"
   (Where—had you slipt, that head were bleaching now!
   And that same rabble, splitting for a hedge,
   Had joined their rows to cheer the active headsman;
   Perchance, in mockery, they'd gird the skull
   With a hop-leaf crown! Bitter the brewing, Noll!)
   Are crowns the end-all of ambition? Remember
   Charles Stuart! and that they who make can break!
   This same Whitehall may black its front with crape,
   And this broad window be the portal twice
   To lead upon a scaffold! Frown! or laugh!
   Laugh on as they did at Cassandra's speech!
   But mark—the prophetess was right! Still laugh,
   Like the credulous Ethiop in his faith in stars!
