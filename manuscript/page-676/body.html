</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Sweet sister, if you knew, like me,
   The charms of guileless infancy,
   No more you'd envy riper years,
   Or smiles, more bitter than your tears.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   But childhood passes in an hour,
   As perfume from a faded flower;
   The joyous voice of early glee
   Flies, like the Halcyon, o'er the sea.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Enjoy your morn of early Spring;
   Soon time maturer thoughts must bring;
   Those hours, like flowers that interclimb,
   Should not be withered ere their time.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
