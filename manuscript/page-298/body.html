   A surging struggle of the inner life.
   Ever the trembling of the grass I say,
   And the boughs rocking as the breezes play,
   Have stirred deep thoughts in a bewild'ring way.
   Oh, God! alone Great Witness of all deeds,
   Of thoughts and acts, and all our human needs,
   God only knows how often in such scenes
   Of savage beauty under leafy screens,
   I've felt the mighty oaks had spirit dower—
   Like me knew mirth and sorrow—sentient power,
   And whisp'ring each to each in twilight dim,
   Had hearts that beat—and owned a soul from Him!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   MRS. NEWTON CROSLAND</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
