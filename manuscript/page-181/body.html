</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XXIX., October, 1843.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To Juana ever gay,
   Sultan Achmet spoke one day
     "Lo, the realms that kneel to own
     Homage to my sword and crown
   All I'd freely cast away,
     Maiden dear, for thee alone."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Be a Christian, noble king!
   For it were a grievous thing:
     Love to seek and find too well
     In the arms of infidel.
   Spain with cry of shame would ring,
     If from honor faithful fell."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
