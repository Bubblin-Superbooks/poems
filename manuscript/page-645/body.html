<p>   That road, who halted, asking, "What's the fright?"
   They told him, and he spurred straight for the site!
   The beast was seen to smile ere joined they fight,
   The man and monster, in most desperate duel,
   Like warring giants, angry, huge, and cruel.
   Stout though the knight, the lion stronger was,
   And tore that brave breast under its cuirass,
   Scrunching that hero, till he sprawled, alas!
   Beneath his shield, all blood and mud and mess:
   Whereat the lion feasted: then it went
   Back to its rocky couch and slept content.
   Sudden, loud cries and clamors! striking out
   Qualm to the heart of the quiet, horn and shout
   Causing the solemn wood to reel with rout.
   Terrific was this noise that rolled before;
   It seemed a squadron; nay, 'twas something moreâ€”
   A whole battalion, sent by that sad</blockquote></div> </div>
