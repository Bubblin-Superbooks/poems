<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Thou canst slumber by the way;
     Thou hast learnt to borrow
   Naught from study, naught from care;
     The cold hand of sorrow
   On thy brow unwrinkled yet,
   Where young truth and candor sit,
   Ne'er with rugged nail hath writ
     That sad word, "To-morrow!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Innocent! thou sleepestâ€”
     See the angelic band,
   Who foreknow the trials
     That for man are planned;
   Seeing him unarmed,
   Unfearing, unalarmed,
   With their tears have warmed
     This unconscious hand.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Still they, hovering o'er him,
     Kiss him where he lies,
   Hark, he sees them weeping,
     "Gabriel!" he cries;
   "Hush!" the angel says,
   On his lip he lays
   One finger, one displays
     His native skies.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
