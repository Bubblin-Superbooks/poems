   Avails t' unclasp the cold and closï¿½d hand.
     Thy voice to disenthrall,
   Dumb phantom, shadow ever at our side!
   Veiled spectre, journeying with us stride for stride,
     Whom men "To-morrow" call.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Oh, to-morrow! who may dare
     Its realities to scan?
   God to-morrow brings to bear
     What to-day is sown by man.
   'Tis the lightning in its shroud,
   'Tis the star-concealing cloud,
   Traitor, 'tis his purpose showing,
   Engine, lofty tow'rs o'erthrowing,
   Wand'ring star, its region changing,
   "Lady of kingdoms," ever ranging.
     To-morrow! 'Tis the rude display
   Of the throne's framework, blank and cold,
   That, rich with velvet, bright with gold,
     Dazzles the eye to-day.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
