<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Say, was it pomp ye needed,
       And all the proud array
   Of courtly joust and high parade
       Upon a gala day?
   Look up; have not my valleys
       Their torrents white with foam—
   Their lines of silver bullion
       On the blue hillocks of home?
   Doth not sweet May embroider
       My rocks with pearls and flowers?
   Her fingers trace a richer lace
       Than yours in all my bowers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Are not my old peaks gilded
       When the sun arises proud,
   And each one shakes a white mist plume
       Out of the thunder-cloud?
   O, neighbor of the golden sky—
       Sons of the mountain sod—
   Why wear a base king's colors
       For the livery of God?
   O shame! despair! to see my Alps
       Their giant shadows fling
   Into the very waiting-room
       Of tyrant and of king!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
