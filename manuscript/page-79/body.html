</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {V., March 11, 1825.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Ho, warriors! I was reared in the land of the Gauls;
   O'er the Rhine my ancestors came bounding like balls
   Of the snow at the Pole, where, a babe, I was bathed
   Ere in bear and in walrus-skin I was enswathed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Then my father was strong, whom the years lowly bow,—
   A bison could wallow in the grooves of his brow.
   He is weak, very old—he can scarcely uptear
   A young pine-tree for staff since his legs cease to bear;</p></blockquote></div> </div>
