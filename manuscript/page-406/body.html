<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Clouds in the skies amass;
   Terrible, alas!
   Thy stern commands are then:
   "Form your battalions, men,
   The flag display!"
   And all obey.
   Angel of might
   Sent kings to smite,
   The words in dark skies glance,
     "Men�, Men�," hiss
     Bolts that never miss!
   Thy name is France,
     Or Nemesis.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   As halcyons in May,
   O nations, in his ray
   Float and bask for aye,
   Nor know decay!
   One arm upraised to heaven
   Seals the past forgiven;
   One holds a sword
   To quell hell's horde,
   Angel of God!
   Thy wings stretch broad
     As heaven's expanse!
     To shield and free
     Humanity!
   Thy name is France,
    Or Liberty!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Footnote 1: Written to music by Beethoven.}</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
