<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">is downward bound:
   He lives, he suffers; in his grasp one day
       Mere dust and ashes found.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I've wandered twenty years, in distant lands,
       With sore heart forced to stay:
   Why fell the blow Fate only understands!
       God took my home away.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To-day one daughter and one son remain
       Of all my goodly show:
   Wellnigh in solitude my dark hours wane;
       God takes my children now.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Linger, ye two still left me! though decays
       Our nest, our hearts remain;
   In gloom of death your mother silent prays,
       I in this life of pain.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
