 Close not the door! Your orders are vain breath—
 That stranger enters to be known as Death—
 Or merely Exile—clothed in alien guise—
 Death drags away—with _his_ prey Exile flies!</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code> Death is that sight. He promenades the hall,
 And casts a gloomy shadow on them all,
 'Neath which they bend like willows soft,
 Ere seizing one—the dumbest monarch oft,
 And bears him to eternal heat and drouth,
 While still the toothsome morsel's in his mouth.</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote><p>   G.W.M. REYNOLDS.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
