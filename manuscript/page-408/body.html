<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   E'en now amid our misery
   The germ of Union many see,
     And through the hedge of thorn,
   Like to a bee that dawn awakes,
   On, Progress strides o'er shattered stakes,
     With solemn, scathing scorn.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Behold the blackness shrink, and flee!
   Behold the world rise up so free
     Of coroneted things!
   Whilst o'er the distant youthful States,
   Like Amazonian bosom-plates,
     Spread Freedom's shielding wings.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Ye, liberated lands, we hail!
   Your sails are whole despite the gale!
   Your masts are firm, and will not fail—
     The triumph follows pain!
   Hear forges roar! the hammer clanks—
   It beats the time to nations' thanks—
     At last, a <em>peaceful</em> strain!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
