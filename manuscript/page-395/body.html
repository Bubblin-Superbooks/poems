   Could not record the ruin of this retreat,
   Unlike a downfall known before or the defeat
   Of Hannibal—reversed and wrapped in gloom!
   Of Attila, when nations met their doom!
   Perished an army—fled French glory then,
   Though there the Emperor! he stood and gazed
   At the wild havoc, like a monarch dazed
   In woodland hoar, who felt the shrieking saw—
   He, living oak, beheld his branches fall, with awe.
   Chiefs, soldiers, comrades died. But still warm love
   Kept those that rose all dastard fear above,
   As on his tent they saw his shadow pass—
   Backwards and forwards, for they credited, alas!
   His fortune's star! it could not, could not be
   That he had not his work to do—a destiny?
   To hurl him headlong from his high estate,
   Would be high treason in his bondman, Fate.
   But all the while he felt himself alone,
   Stunned with disasters few have ever known.
