   Feel with both hands—with both huge arms go stretch

   Who knows—there <em>may</em>! Those great hands might so come
   In course of ghastly fumble through the gloom,
   Upon a sword—a <em>sword</em>! The hands once clasp
   Its hilt, must wield it with a Victor's grasp.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   EDWIN ARNOLD, C.S.I.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Footnote 1: The Battle of Mentana, so named from a village by Rome, was
