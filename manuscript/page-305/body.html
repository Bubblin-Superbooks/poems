   Shadow and milk seek in the eternal flank;
   Mystic and carnal, foolish, wise, repair,
   The souls retiring and those that dare,
   Sages with halos, poets laurel-crowned,
   All creep beneath or cluster close around,
   And with unending greed and joyous cries,
   From sources full, draw need's supplies,
   Quench hearty thirst, obtain what must eftsoon
   Form blood and mind, in freest boon,
   Respire at length thy sacred flaming light,
   From all that greets our ears, touch, scent or sight—
   Brown leaves, blue mountains, yellow gleams, green sod—
   Thou undistracted still dost dream of God.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   TORU DUTT.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
