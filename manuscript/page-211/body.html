   With smiling eyes its smiling eyes behold,
       And artless, babyish joy;
   A playful welcome greets it through the room,
   The saddest brow unfolds its wrinkled gloom,
       To greet the happy boy.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   If June with flowers has spangled all the ground,
   Or winter bleak the flickering hearth around
       Draws close the circling seat;
   The child still sheds a never-failing light;
