   Of Aarhuus came the Bishop prayers to say,
   And sang a hymn upon his tomb, and held
   That Canute was a saintâ€”Canute the Great,
   That from his memory breathed celestial perfume,
   And that they saw him, they the priests, in glory,
   Seated at God's right hand, a prophet crowned.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
