   As I sit on the hill my feet swing in the flax,

   I brushed snowy periwigs off granitic scalps,
   And my head, o'er the pinnacles, stopped the fleet clouds,
   Where I captured the eagles and caged them by crowds.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   There were tempests! I blew them back into their source!
   And put out their lightnings! More than once in a course,
   Through the ocean I went wading after the whale,
   And stirred up the bottom as did never a gale.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
