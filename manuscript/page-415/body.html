<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">friends!
   Pride in the powerful no more, no less than in the poor;
   Hatred in both their bosoms; love in one, or, wondrous! two!
   Fog in the valleys; on the mountains snowfields, ever new,
   That only melt to send down waters for the liquid hell,
   In which, their strongest sons and fairest daughters vilely fell!
   No marvel, Justice, Modesty dwell far apart and high,
   Where they can feebly hear, and, rarer, answer victims' cry.
   At both extremes, unflinching frost, the centre scorching hot;
   Land storms that strip the orchards nude, leave beaten grain to rot;
   Oceans that rise with sudden force to wash the bloody land,
   Where War, amid sob-drowning cheers, claps weapons in each hand.
   And this to those who, luckily, abide afarâ€”
   This is, ha! ha! <em>a star</em>!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
