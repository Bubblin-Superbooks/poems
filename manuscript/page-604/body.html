   Come, sit with those who live as exiles learn:
   Come! Thou whom kings could conquer but not yet turn.

   Old Homer in the quiet summer weather,
   And after, thou shalt go to thy desire
   While that faint star of Justice grows to fire.{3}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   V.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Oh, Italy! hail your Deliverer,
