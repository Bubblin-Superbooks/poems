   You have recovered liberty,
   Fresh air and lovely scenery,
   The spacious park and wished-for grass;
     The running stream, where you can throw
   A blade to watch what comes to pass;
     Blue sky, and all the spring can show;
   Nature, serenely fair to see;
   The book of birds and spirits free,
   God's poem, worth much more than mine,
   Where flowers for perfect stanzas shine—
   Flowers that a child may pluck in play,
   No harsh voice frightening it away.
   And I'm alone—all pleasure o'er—
     Alone with pedant called "Ennui,"
   For since the morning at my door
     Ennui has waited patiently.
   That docto-r-London born, you mark,
   One Sunday in December dark,
   Poor little ones—he loved you not,
   And waited till the chance he got
   To enter as you passed away,
     And in the very corner where
   You played with frolic laughter gay,
     He sighs and yawns with weary air.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
