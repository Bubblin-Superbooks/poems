   Couch-grass and ivy, and wild eglantine
   In subtle scaling warfare all combine.
   Subject to such attacks three hundred years,
   The donjon yields, and ruin now appears,
   E'en as by leprosy the wild boars die,
   In moat the crumbled battlements now lie;
   Around the snake-like bramble twists its rings;
   Freebooter sparrows come on daring wings
   To perch upon the swivel-gun, nor heed
   Its murmuring growl when pecking in their greed
   The mulberries ripe. With insolence the thorn
   Thrives on the desolation so forlorn.
   But winter brings revenges; then the Keep
   Wakes all vindictive from its seeming sleep,
   Hurls down the heavy rain, night after night,
   Thanking the season's all-resistless might;
   And, when the gutters choke, its gargoyles four
   From granite mouths in anger spit and pour
   Upon the hated ivy hour by hour.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
