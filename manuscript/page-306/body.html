</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XX., June, 1884.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   See all the children gathered there,
   Their mother near; so young, so fair,
   An eider sister she might be,
   And yet she hears, amid their games,
   The shaking of their unknown names
     In the dark urn of destiny.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   She wakes their smiles, she soothes their cares,
   On that pure heart so like to theirs,
     Her spirit with such life is rife
   That in its golden rays we see,
   Touched into graceful poesy,
     The dull cold commonplace of life.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
