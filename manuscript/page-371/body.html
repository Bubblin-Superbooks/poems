     When boy I sought for forest fowl,
   And caged them in rude rushes' mesh,
     And fed them with my breakfast roll;
   So that, though fragile were the door,
     They rarely fled, and even then
   Would flutter back at faintest call!</p></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code> Man-grown, I charm for men.</code></pre></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
