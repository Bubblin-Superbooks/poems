     Consume, in point of cost, food at a single meal
   Much less than what is spread before this crowned man—-
     Who rules his couchant nation with a rod of steel,
   And whose servitors' chiefest arts it was to squeeze

     In its variety, trying to find what never sates.
   Laughs at the holy writings and the text divine,
     O'er which the humble dervish prays and venerates.
   There is a common saying which holds often good:
