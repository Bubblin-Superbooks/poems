   On her the past has left no staining mark;
   Nor knows she aught of those bad thoughts which, dark
     Like shade on waters, o'er the spirit glide.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   She knows not—nor mayest thou—the miseries
   In which our spirits mingle: vanities,
     Remorse, soul-gnawing cares, Pleasure's false show:
   Passions which float upon the heart like foam,
   Bitter remembrances which o'er us come,
     And Shame's red spot spread sudden o'er the brow.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I know life better! when thou'rt older grown
   I'll tell thee—it is needful to be known—
     Of the pursuit of wealth—art, power; the cost.
   That it is folly, nothingness: that shame
   For glory is oft thrown us in the game
     Of Fortune; chances where the soul is lost.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
