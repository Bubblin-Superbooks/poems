     And seeks, in the cold mists of life,
   Those poor forsaken little ones
     Who droop and weary in the strife.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Ah, most her heart is stirred for them,
     Whose foreheads, wrapped in mists obscure,
   Still wear a triple diademâ€”
     The young, the innocent, the poor.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And they are better far than we,
     And she bestows a worthier meed;
   For, with the loaf of charity,
     She gives the kiss that children need.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   She gives, and while they wondering eat
     The tear-steeped bread by love supplied,
   She stretches round them in the street
     Her arm that passers push aside.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
