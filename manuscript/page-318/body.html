   Children whose life is made of hope,
   Whose joy, within its mystic scope,
   Owes all to ignorance of ill,
   You have not suffered, and you still
   Know not what gloomy thoughts weigh down
   The poet-writer weary grown.
   What warmth is shed by your sweet smile!
   How much he needs to gaze awhile
   Upon your shining placid brow,
   When his own brow its ache doth know;
   With what delight he loves to hear
   Your frolic play 'neath tree that's near,
   Your joyous voices mixing well
   With his own song's all-mournful swell!
   Come back then, children! come to me,
   If you wish not that I should be
   As lonely now that you're afar
   As fisherman of Etr�tat,
   Who listless on his elbow leans
   Through all the weary winter scenes,
   As tired of thought—as on Time flies—
   And watching only rainy skies!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
