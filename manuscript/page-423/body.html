     There are other angels in the skyâ€”
   There, where nothing changes, nothing suffers,
     Sweet it were to enter in on high.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To that dome on marvellous pilasters,
     To that tent roofed o'er with colored bars,
   That blue garden full of stars like lilies,
     And of lilies beautiful as stars.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
