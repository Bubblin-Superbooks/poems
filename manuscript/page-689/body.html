</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {ANGELO, Act II., May, 1835.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   My soul unto thy heart is given,
     In mystic fold do they entwine,
   So bound in one that, were they riven,
     Apart my soul would life resign.
   Thou art my song and I the lyre;
   Thou art the breeze and I the brier;
   The altar I, and thou the fire;
     Mine the deep love, the beauty thine!
   As fleets away the rapid hour
     While weeping—may
     My sorrowing lay
   Touch thee, sweet flower.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   ERNEST OSWALD COE.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
