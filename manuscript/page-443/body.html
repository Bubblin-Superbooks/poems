   The <em>Reiters</em> are mounted! the Reiters will come!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   When our bullets cease singing
   And long swords cease ringing
       On backplates of fearsomest foes in full flight,
   We'll dig up their dollars
   To string for girls' collarsâ€”
       They'll jingle around them before it is night!
               When flourish the trumpets, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
