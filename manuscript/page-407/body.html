   When man has 'scaped the trackless slime
     And reached the desert spring;
   When sands are crossed, the sward invites
   The worn to rest 'mid rare delights
     And gratefully to sing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   E'en now the eye that's levelled high,
   Though dimly, can the hope espy
     So solid soon, one day;
   For every chain must then be broke,
   And hatred none will dare evoke,
     And June shall scatter May.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
