<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">I know not if the rock, or tree o'erhead,
   Had heard their speech;â€”but when the two spoke low,
   Among the trees, a shudder seemed to go
   Through all their branches, just as if that way
   A beast had passed to trouble and dismay.
   More dark the shadow of the rock was seen,
   And then a morsel of the shade, between
   The sombre trees, took shape as it would seem
   Like spectre walking in the sunset's gleam.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   It is not monster rising from its lair,
   Nor phantom of the foliage and the air,
   It is not morsel of the granite's shade
   That walks in deepest hollows of the glade.
   'Tis not a vampire nor a spectre pale
   But living man in rugged coat of mail.
   It is Alsatia's noble Chevalier,
   Eviradnus the brave, that now is here.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
