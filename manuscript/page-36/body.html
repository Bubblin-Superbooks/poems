       For which she's ever on the watch
       Some glance to catch
   Suspiciously directed to its locks;
   And Envy, too, no doubt with silent winking
       At her green, greedy orbs, no single minute
   Withdrawn from it, was hard a-thinking

       "There's not enough, enough, yet in my store!"

   Groaned as she gnashed her yellow teeth with spite,
       "She's more than me, more, still forever more!"</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Thus, each in her own fashion, as they wandered,
