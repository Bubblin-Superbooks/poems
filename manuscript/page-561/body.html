     The Cup was always drunk, in wit did ever fail;
   But you fling gleams forth brightly, dazzling as a torch;
     Vainly to quell your power all Night's attempts are spent;
   The murky, black-eyed clouds you eat away and scorch,
     Making where'er you spring to life an Orient.
   To charm your lord give voice, thou spark of paradise!
     Speak forth against the Sphinxes' enigmatic word,
   And 'gainst the Wine-Cup, with its sharp and biting spice!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE LAMP.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Oh, Crusher of Countless Cities, such as earth knew

   Were built</blockquote></div> </div>
