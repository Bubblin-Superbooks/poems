   Come where the autumn winds never can sweep,
   And the streams of the woodland steep thee in sleep,
   Like a fond sister charming the eyes of a brother,
   Or a little lass lulled on the breast of her mother.
   Beautiful! beautiful! hasten to me!
   Colored with crimson thy wings shall be;
   Flowers that fade not thy forehead shall twine,
   Over thee sunlight that sets not shall shine.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The infant listened to the strain,
   Now here, now there, its thoughts were driven—
     But the Fay and the Peri waited in vain,
     The soul soared above such a sensual gain—
   The child rose to Heaven.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Asiatic Journal</em>
