   Just at the forest's edge a clerk was met
   With wine in sacred cup and purpose set,
   A wine mysterious, which the heir must drink
   To cause deep slumber till next day's soft brink.
   Then to the castle tower he wends his way,
   And finds a supper laid with rich display.
   He sups and sleeps: then to his slumbering eyes
   The shades of kings from Bela all arise.
   None dare the tower to enter on this night,
   But when the morning dawns, crowds are in sight
   The dreamer to deliver,—whom half dazed,
   And with the visions of the night amazed,
   They to the old church take, where rests the dust
   Of Borivorus; then the bishop must,
   With fervent blessings on his eyes and mouth,
   Put in his hands the stony hatchets both,
   With which—even like death impartially—
   Struck Attila, with one arm dexterously
   The south, and with the other arm the north.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
