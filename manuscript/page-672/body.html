   There's nothing fairer here below,
     There's nothing grander up in heaven,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Than when caressingly she stands
     (The cold hearts wakening 'gain their beat),
   And holds within her holy hands
     The little children's naked feet.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To every den of want and toil
     She goes, and leaves the poorest fed;
   Leaves wine and bread, and genial oil,
     And hopes that blossom in her tread,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And fire, too, beautiful bright fire,
     That mocks the glowing dawn begun,
   Where, having set the blind old sire,
     He dreams he's sitting in the sun.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
