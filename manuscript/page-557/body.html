<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Who would see Cleopatra on her bed?
   Come in. The place is filled with fog like lead,
   Which clammily has settled on the frame
   Of her who was a burning, dazzling flame
   To all mankind—who durst not lift their gaze,
   And meet the brightness of her beauty's rays.
   Her teeth were pearls, her breath a rare perfume.
   Men died with love on entering her room.
   Poised 'twixt the world and her—acme of joys!
   Antony took her of the double choice.
   The ice-cold heart that passion seldom warms,
   Would find heat torrid in that queen's soft arms.
   She won without a single woman's wile,
   Illumining the earth with peerless smile.
   Come in!—but muffle closely up your face,
   No grateful scents have ta'en sweet odors' place.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE TENTH SPHINX.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
