<p>   Oh Sire! 'tis wrong upon the dying lion
   To loose thy dog!  <em>(Turns to Triboulet)</em>
                      And thou, whoe'er thou art,
   That with a fiendish sneer and viper's tongue
   Makest my tears a pastime and a sport,
   My curse upon thee!—Sire, thy brow doth bear
   The gems of France!—on mine, old age doth sit;
   Thine decked with jewels, mine with these gray hairs;
   We both are Kings, yet bear a different crown;
   And should some impious hand upon thy head
   Heap wrongs and insult, with thine own strong arm
   Thou canst avenge them! <em>God avenges mine!</em>
