<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><pre><code> For mother's worship, and for children's bloom,</code></pre>
<p>   For song, for smile, for love so fair and fresh,
     For laugh, for dance, there is one goalâ€”the tomb."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And why does Janet pass so fast away?
     What hath she done within that house of dread?
   What foldeth she beneath her mantle gray?
     And hurries home, and hides it in her bed:
     With half-averted face, and nervous tread,
     What hath she stolen from the awful dead?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The dawn was whitening over the sea's verge
     As she sat pensive, touching broken chords
   Of half-remorseful thought, while the hoarse surge
     Howled a sad concert to her broken words.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
