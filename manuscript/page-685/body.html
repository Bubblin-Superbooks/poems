<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   When thy sleep like the moonlight above
           Lulling the sea,
   Doth enwind thee in visions of love,
           Perchance, of me!
   I can watch so in dream that enthralled me,
           Never before!
   Sleep on, sleep on, my fair one!
           Sleep on for evermore.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   HENRY F. CHORLEY.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
