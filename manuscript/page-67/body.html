</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Bk. V. viii., April, 1822.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The mist of the morning is torn by the peaks,
     Old towers gleam white in the ray,
   And already the glory so joyously seeks
     The lark that's saluting the day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Then smile away, man, at the heavens so fair,
     Though, were you swept hence in the night,
   From your dark, lonely tomb the owlets would stare
     At the sun rising newly as bright.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
