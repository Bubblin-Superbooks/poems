</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Bk. XV. ii. 10.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The good steed flew o'er river and o'er plain,
   Till far away,â€”no need of spur or rein.
   The child, half rapture, half solicitude,
   Looks back anon, in fear to be pursued;
   Shakes lest some raging brother of his sire
   Leap from those rocks that o'er the path aspire.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
