   Where pillars rudely grayed by rusty nail
   Of heavy hours reveal the weary tale;
   Where spiteful ushers grin, all pleased to make
   Long scribbled lines the price of each mistake.
   By four unpitying walls environed there
   The homesick students pace the pavements bare.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   E.E. FREWER</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
