     To enjoy in this pure and happy retreat,
   All that nature to timid love can impart
     Of solemn repose and communion sweet.
   In <em>our</em> fields, in <em>our</em> paths, shall strangers stray,
     In <em>thy</em> wood, my dearest, new lovers go lost,
   And other fair forms in the stream shall play
     Which of old thy delicate feet have crossed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Author of "Critical Essays."</em>
