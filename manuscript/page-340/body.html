   Ye birds will sing, ye bending boughs with verdure glad the sight;
   The ivy root in the stone entwined, will cause old gates to fall;
   The church-bell sound to work or rest the villagers will call.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Ye glorious oaks will still increase in solitude profound,
   Where the far west in distance lies as evening veils around;
   Ye willows, to the earth your arms in mournful trail will bend,
   And back again your mirror'd forms the water's surface send.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Ye nests will oscillate beneath the youthful progeny;
   Embraced in furrows of the earth the germing grain will lie;
   Ye lightning-torches still your streams will cast into the air,
   Which like a troubled spirit's course float wildly</blockquote></div> </div>
