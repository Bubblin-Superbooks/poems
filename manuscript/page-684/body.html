</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   When the voice of thy lute at the eve
           Charmeth the ear,
   In the hour of enchantment believe
           What I murmur near.
   That the tune can the Age of Gold
           With its magic restore.
   Play on, play on, my fair one,
           Play on for evermore.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   When thy laugh like the song of the dawn
           Riseth so gay
   That the shadows of Night are withdrawn
           And melt away,
   I remember my years of care
           And misgiving no more.
   Laugh on, laugh on, my fair one,
           Laugh on for evermore.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
