   And, like an infant's playthings,
     These houses decked with gold.
   I love forsooth these reveries,
     Though sandstorms make me pant,
   Voluptuously swaying
     Upon an elephant.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Here in this fairy palace,
     Full of such melodies,
   Methinks I hear deep murmurs
     That in the deserts rise;
   Soft mingling with the music
     The Genii's voices pour,
   Amid the air, unceasing,
     Around us evermore.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I love the burning odors
     This glowing region gives;
   And, round each gilded lattice,
     The trembling, wreathing leaves;
   And, 'neath the bending palm-tree,
     The gayly gushing spring;
   And on the snow-white minaret,
     The stork with snowier wing.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
