<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Oh, gentle face, radiant with happy smile,
   And eager prattling tongue that knows no guile,
       Quick changing tears and bliss;
   Thy soul expands to catch this new world's light,
   Thy mazed eyes to drink each wondrous sight,
       Thy lips to taste the kiss.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Oh, God! bless me and mine, and these I love,
   And e'en my foes that still triumphant prove
       Victors by force or guile;
   A flowerless summer may we never see,
   Or nest of bird bereft, or hive of bee,
       Or home of infant's smile.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   HENRY HIGHTON, M.A.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
