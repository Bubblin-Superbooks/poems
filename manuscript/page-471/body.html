<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">one who mounted on the tower could gain
   A view beyond the pines and rocks, of spires
   That pierce the shade the distant scene acquires;
   A walled town is it, but 'tis not ally
   Of the old citadel's proud majesty;
   Unto itself belonging this remained.
   Often a castle was thus self-sustained
   And equalled towns; witness in Lombardy
   Crama, and Plato too in Tuscany,
   And in Apulia Barletta;â€”each one
   Was powerful as a town, and dreaded none.
   Corbus ranked thus; its precincts seemed to hold
   The reflex of its mighty kings of old;
   Their great events had witness in these walls,
   Their marriages were here and funerals,
   And mostly here it was that they were born;
   And here crowned Barons ruled with pride and scorn;
   Cradle of Scythian majesty this place.
   Now each new master of this ancient race
   A duty owed to ancestors which he
   Was bound to carry on. The law's decree
   It was that he should pass alone the night
