   A love that from the heart eats every passion
   But its sole self; love without hope or limit,
   Deep love that will outlast all happiness;
   Speak, speak; is such the love you bear me?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   MARION.                                      Truly.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   DIDIER. Ha! but you do not know how I love you!
   The day that first I saw you, the dark world
   Grew shining, for your eyes lighted my gloom.
   Since then, all things have changed; to me you are
   Some brightest, unknown creature from the skies.
   This irksome life, 'gainst which my heart rebelled,
   Seems almost fair and pleasant; for, alas!
   Till I knew you wandering, alone, oppressed,
   I wept and struggled, I had never loved.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
