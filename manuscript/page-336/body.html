     All joy and hope possessing,
   With mind in pureness cast,
     Sweet ignorance confessing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Plant, safe from winds and showers,
     Heart with soft visions glowing,
   In childhood's happy hours
     A mother's rapture showing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Loved by each anxious friend,
     No carking care withinâ€”
   When summer gambols end,
     My winter sports begin.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Sweet poesy from heaven
     Around thy form is placed,
   A mother's beauty given,
     By father's thought is graced!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
