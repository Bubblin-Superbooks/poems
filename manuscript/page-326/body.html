</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XXVI., February, 1835.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Young maiden, true love is a pool all mirroring clear,
     Where coquettish girls come to linger in long delight,
   For it banishes afar from the face all the clouds that besmear
       The soul truly bright;
   But tempts you to ruffle its surface; drawing your foot
     To subtilest sinking! and farther and farther the brink
   That vainly you snatch—for repentance, 'tis weed without root,—
       And struggling, you sink!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
