<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Blushing like a living rose,
     On her bosom swelling high
         If a fly
   Dare to seek a sweet repose.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In those eyes which maiden pride
         Fain would hide,
   Mark how passion's lightnings sleep!
     And their glance is brighter far
         Than the star
   Brightest in heaven's bluest deep.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   O'er her limbs the glittering current
         In soft torrent
   Rains adown the gentle girl,
     As if, drop by drop, should fall,
        One and all
   From her necklace every pearl.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Lengthening still the reckless pleasure
         At her leisure,
   Care-free Zara ever slow
     As the hammock floats and swings
         Smiles and sings,
   To herself, so sweet and low.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
