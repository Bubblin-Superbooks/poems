<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Here the forest contracts, there the mead extends,
     Of all that was ours, there is little left—
   Like the ashes that wildly are whisked by winds,
     Of all souvenirs is the place bereft.
   Do we live no more—is our hour then gone?
     Will it give back naught to our hungry cry?
   The breeze answers my call with a mocking tone,
     The house that was mine makes no reply.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   True! others shall pass, as we have passed,
     As we have come, so others shall meet,
   And the dream that our mind had sketched in haste,
     Shall others continue, but never complete.
   For none upon earth can achieve his scheme,
     The best as the worst are futile here:
   We awake at the selfsame point cf the dream—
     All is here begun, and finished elsewhere.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
