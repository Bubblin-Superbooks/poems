   Recoiled to near the unseen opening wide;
   The human club was raised, and struck again \ \ <br>   And Eviradnus did alone remain
   All empty-handedâ€”but he heard the sound
   Of spectres two falling to depths profound;
   Then, stooping o'er the pit, he gazed below,
   And, as half-dreaming now, he murmured low,
   "Tiger and jackal meet their portion here,
   'Tis well together they should disappear!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   XVIII.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
