</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The leaves that in the lonely walks were spread,
   Starting from off the ground beneath the tread,
           Coursed o'er the garden-plain;
   Thus, sometimes, 'mid the soul's deep sorrowings,
   Our soul a moment mounts on wounded wings,
           Then, swiftly, falls again.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
