</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {VI., October, 1825.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   My lord the Duke of Brittany
       Has summoned his barons bold—
   Their names make a fearful litany!
   Among them you will not meet any
       But men of giant mould.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Proud earls, who dwell in donjon keep,
       And steel-clad knight and peer,
   Whose forts are girt with a moat cut deep—
   But none excel in soldiership
       My own loved cymbaleer.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
