                                     Do but try
   The question with a steady moral eye!
   The colonel strives to be a brigadier,
   The marshal, constable. Call the game fair,
   And pay your winners! Show the trump, I say!
   A renegade's a rascal—till the day
   They make him Pasha: is he rascal then?
   What with these sequins? Bah! you speak to Men,
   And Men want money—power—luck—life's joy—
   Those take who can: we could, and fobbed Savoy;
   For those who live content with honest state,
   They're public pests; knock we 'em on the pate!
   They set a vile example! Quick—arrest
   That Fool, who ruled and failed to line his nest.
   Just hit a bell, you'll see the clapper shake—
   Meddle with Priests, you'll find the barrack wake—
   Ah! Princes know the People's a tight boot,
   March 'em sometimes to be shot and to shoot,
   Then they'll wear easier. So let them preach
   The righteousness of howitzers;</blockquote></div> </div>
