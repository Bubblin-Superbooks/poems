   Oh! what will unrestoring Death, that jealous tyrant lord,
   Do with the brave departed souls that cannot swing a sword?
   Why turned the balls aside from me? Why struck no hostile hand
   My head within its turban green upon the ruddy sand?
   I stood all potent yesterday; my bravest captains three,
   All stirless in their tigered selle, magnificent to see,
   Hailed as before my gilded tent rose flowing to the gales,
   Shorn from the tameless desert steeds, three dark and tossing tails.
   But yesterday a hundred drums were heard when I went by;
   Full forty agas turned their looks respectful on mine eye,
   And trembled with contracted brows within their hall of state.
   Instead of heavy catapults, of slow unwieldy weight,
   I had bright cannons rolling on oak wheels in threatening tiers,
   And calm and steady by their sides marched English cannoniers.
