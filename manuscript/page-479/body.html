<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">wrath empurpled—came these words of late:
   "The empire wearies of the wallet weight
   Hung at its back—this High and Low Lusace,
   Whose hateful load grows heavier apace,
   That now a woman holds its ruler's place."
   Threatening, and blood suggesting, every word;
   The watchful Pole was silent—but he heard.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Two monstrous dangers; but the heedless one
   Babbles and smiles, and bids all care begone—
   Likes lively speech—while all the poor she makes
   To love her, and the taxes off she takes.
   A life of dance and pleasure she has known—
   A woman always; in her jewelled crown
   It is the pearl she loves—not cutting gems,
   For these can wound, and mark men's diadems.
   She pays the hire of Homer's copyists,
   And in the Courts of Love presiding, lists.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
