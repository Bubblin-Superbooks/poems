   And having stupidly insulted me
   'Tis needful that she die. To blurt all out—
   I know that you desire her; without doubt
   The flame that rages in my heart warms yours;
   To carry out these subtle plans of ours,
   We have become as gypsies near this doll,
   You as her page—I dotard to control—
   Pretended gallants changed to lovers now.

   Sooner or later, 'gainst our best intent
   About her we should quarrel. Evident

   There is one only thing for us to do,
   And that is, kill her."</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>                      "Logic very clear,"</code></pre>
