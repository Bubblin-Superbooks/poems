     She brought the rescued infant slowly out
   Beyond the humid sands; at her approach
     Her curious maidens hurried round about
   To kiss the new-born brow with gentlest touch;
     Greeting the child with smiles, and bending nigh
     Their faces o'er his large, astonished eye!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Haste thou who, from afar, in doubt and fear,
     Dost watch, with straining eyes, the fated boyâ€”
   The loved of heaven! come like a stranger near,
     And clasp young Moses with maternal joy;
   Nor fear the speechless transport and the tear
     Will e'er betray thy fond and hidden claim,
     For Iphis knows not yet a mother's name!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
