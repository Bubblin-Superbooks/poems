   Full faith accord the angel
     Who points the patient blade.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The traitor still may nestle
     In balmy bed of state,
   But mark the Warder, watching
     His guardsman at his gate.
   He wears the crown, a monarch—
     Of knaves and stony hearts;
   But though they're blessed by Senates,
     None can escape the darts!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Though shored by spear and crozier,
     All know the arrant cheat,
   And shun the square of pavement
     Uncertain at his feet!
   Yea, spare the wretch, each brooding
     And secret-leaguers' chief,
   And make no pistol-target
     Of stars upon the thief.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
