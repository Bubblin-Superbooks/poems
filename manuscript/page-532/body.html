   Of these young men and that young girl just now!
   Oh! can you really be of human kind
   Breathing pure air of heaven? Do we find
   That you are men? Oh, no! for when you laid
   Foul lips upon the mouth of sleeping maid,
   You seemed but ghouls that had come furtively
   From out the tombs; only a horrid lie
   Your human shape; of some strange frightful beast
   You have the soul. To darkness I at least
   Remit you now. Oh, murderer Sigismond
   And Ladisl�us pirate, both beyond
   Release—two demons that have broken ban!
   Therefore 'tis time their empire over man
   And converse with the living, should be o'er;
   Tyrants, behold your tomb your eyes before;
   Vampires and dogs, your sepulchre is here.
   Enter."</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>           He pointed to the gulf so near.</code></pre>
