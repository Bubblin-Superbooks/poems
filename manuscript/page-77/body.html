       To haunt thy holy dwelling;
   Pale ghosts are, perhaps, stealing into the room—
   Oh, would that the lamp were relit! with the gloom
       These fearful thoughts dispelling.
   Thou hast told us our parents lie sleeping beneath
       The grass, in a churchyard lonely:
   Now, thine eyes have no motion, thy mouth has no breath,
   And thy limbs are all rigid! Oh, say, <em>Is this death</em>,
       Or thy prayer or thy slumber only?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   ENVOY.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Sad vigil they kept by that grandmother's chair,
       Kind angels hovered o'er them—
   And the dead-bell was tolled in the hamlet—and there,
   On the following eve, knelt that innocent pair,
       With the missal-book before them.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
