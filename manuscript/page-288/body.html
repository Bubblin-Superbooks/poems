</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XXVII., Dec. 7, 1834.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The grave receives us all:
     Ye butterflies and roses gay and sweet
   Why do ye linger, say?
     Will ye not dwell together as is meet?
   Somewhere high in the air
     Would thy wing seek a home 'mid sunny skies,
   In mead or mossy dellâ€”
     If there thy odors longest, sweetest rise.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Have where ye will your dwelling,
     Or breath or tint whose praise we sing;
   Butterfly shining bright,
     Full-blown or bursting rosebud, flow'r or wing.
   Dwell together ye fair,
    </blockquote></div> </div>
