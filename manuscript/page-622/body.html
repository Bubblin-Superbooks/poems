         If still, beneath the skies,
   You turn, O Jeanne, on our mystery
         Soft, discontented eyes!
   If I behold you, gay and strong no more;
         If you mope sadly thus;
   If you behind you have not shut the door,
         Through which you came to us;
   If you no more like some fair dame I see
         Laugh, walk, be well and gay;
   If like a little soul you seem to me
         That fain would fly away—
   I'll deem that to this world, where oft are blent
         The pall and swaddling-band,
   You came but to depart—an angel sent
         To bear me from the land.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   LUCY H. HOOPER.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
