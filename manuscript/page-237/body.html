   Victorious garland, red and vast!
     Which blooming out from home did go
     To Cadiz, Cairo, Rome, Moscow,
   From Jemappes to Montmirail passed!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Of warlike Lyceums{1} ye are
   The favored sons; there, deeds of war
   Formed e'en your plays, while o'er you shook
     The battle-flags in air aloft!
     Passing your lines, Napoleon oft
   Electrified you with a look!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Eagle of France! whose vivid wing
   Did in a hundred places fling
   A bloody feather, till one night
     The arrow whelmed thee 'neath the wave!
     Look up—rejoice—for now thy brave
   And worthy eaglets dare the light.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   ELIZABETH COLLINS.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
