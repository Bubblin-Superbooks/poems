 That sagest lose their heads in such a rout!
 In the long laughter, ceaseless roaming round,
 Joy, mirth and glee give out a maelstr�m's sound;
 And the astonished gazer casts his care,
 Where ev'ry eyeball glistens in the flare.</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code> But oh! while yet the singing Hebes pour
 Forgetfulness of those without the door—
 At very hour when all are most in joy,
 And the hid orchestra annuls annoy,
 Woe—woe! with jollity a-top the heights,
 With further tapers adding to the lights,
 And gleaming 'tween the curtains on the street,
 Where poor folks stare—hark to the heavy feet!
 Some one smites roundly on the gilded grate,
 Some one below will be admitted straight,
