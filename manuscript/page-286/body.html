<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Since I have known upon my forehead glance and gleam,
     A ray, a single ray, of your star, veiled always,
   Since I have felt the fall upon my lifetime's stream,
      Of one rose-petal plucked from the roses of your days;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I now am bold to say to the swift-changing hours,
     Passâ€”pass upon your way, for I grow never old.
   Flee to the dark abysm with all your fading flowers,
     One rose that none may pluck, within my heart I hold.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Your flying wings may smite, but they can never spill
     The cup fulfilled of love, from which my lips are wet.
   My heart has far more fire than you have frost to chill,
     My soul more love than you can make my love forget.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
