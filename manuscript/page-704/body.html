   With lance, or axe, or falchion, and by day,
   Bravely they won and wore her. As for those
   Who slip through streets when honest men repose,
   With eyes turned to the ground, and in night's shade
   The rights of trusting husbands to invade;
   I say the Cid would force such knaves as these
   To beg the city's pardon on their knees;
   And with the flat of his all-conquering blade
   Their rank usurped and 'scutcheon would degrade.
   Thus would the men of former times, I say,
   Treat the degenerate minions of to-day.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   LORD F. LEVESON GOWER (1ST EARL OF ELLESMERE.)</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
