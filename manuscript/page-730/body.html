   But cry you: Look on John, who bares his mind
   To Oliver—to Cromwell, Milton speaks!
   Despite a kindling eye and marvel deep
   A voice is lifted up without your leave;
   For I was never placed at council board
   To speak <em>my</em> promptings. When awed strangers come
   Who've seen Fox-Mazarin wince at the stings
   In my epistles—and bring admiring votes
   Of learned colleges, they strain to see
