<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   "Then my rich robes trailing show
         As I go,
   None to chide should be so bold;
     And upon my sandals fine
         How should shine
   Rubies worked in cloth-of-gold!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Fancying herself a queen,
         All unseen,
   Thus vibrating in delight;
     In her indolent coquetting
         Quite forgetting
   How the hours wing their flight.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   As she lists the showery tinkling
         Of the sprinkling
   By her wanton curvets made;
     Never pauses she to think
         Of the brink
   Where her wrapper white is laid.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To the harvest-fields the while,
         In long file,
   Speed her sisters' lively band,
     Like a flock of birds in flight
         Streaming light,
   Dancing onward hand in hand.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
