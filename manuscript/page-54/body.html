     Of breezes, sighing of thee, in mine ear;
   The strange awaking from a dream of death,
     The sudden thrill to find thee coming near?
     Our huts were desolate, and far away
     I heard thee calling me throughout the day,
       No one had seen thee pass,
       Trembling I came. Alas!
               Can I forget?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Once I was beautiful; my maiden charms
     Died with the grief that from my bosom fell.
   Ah! weary traveller!</blockquote></div> </div>
