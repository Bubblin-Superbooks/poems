     Lo, a rill upsprings,
   And from out its bosom
     Comes a voice that sings
   Lovelier there appear
   Sire and sisters dear,
   While his mother near
     Plumes her new-born wings.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   But a brighter vision
     Yet his eyes behold;
   Roses pied and lilies
     Every path enfold;
   Lakes delicious sleeping,
   Silver fishes leaping,
   Through the wavelets creeping
     Up to reeds of gold.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Slumber on, sweet infant,
     Slumber peacefully
   Thy young soul yet knows not
     What thy lot may be.
   Like dead weeds that sweep
   O'er the dol'rous deep,
   Thou art borne in sleep.
     What is all to thee?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
