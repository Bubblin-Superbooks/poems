<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Towering shaft, and peak of snow,
       And heaven's archâ€”O, can you see

   And a steed that from the war
       Bears my lover back to me?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   JOHN L. O'SULLIVAN.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
