<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">scourges of the Greeks and Hebrews,
   Harsh and bloodthirsty, narrow in their views.
   Against the pure scroll of the sky, a blot,
   Stands out her sepulchre, a fatal spot
   That seems a baneful breath around to spread.
   The birds which chance to near it, drop down dead.
   The queen is now attended on by shades,
   Which have replaced, in horrid guise, her maids.
   No life is hereâ€”the law says such as bore
   A corpse alone may enter through yon door.
   Before, behind, around the queen, her sight
   Encounters but the same blank void of night.
   Above, the pilasters are like to bars,
   And, through their gaps, the dead look at the stars,
   While, till the dawn, around Nitrocis' bones,
   Spectres hold council, crouching on the stones.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE SECOND SPHINX.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
