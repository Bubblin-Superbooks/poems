<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">end thou art of wrestlings and of prayer,
   Of sleepless watch, long marches, hunger, tears
   And blood prolifically spilled, homes lordless,
   And homeless lords! The mass must always suffer
   That one should reign! the collar's but newly clamp'd,
   And nothing but the name thereon is changed—
   Master? still masters! mark you not the red
   Of shame unutterable in my sightless white?
   Still hear me, Cromwell, speaking for your sake!
   These fifteen years, we, to you whole-devoted,
   Have sought for Liberty—to give it thee?
   To make our interests your huckster gains?
   The king a lion slain that you may flay,
   And wear the robe—well, worthily—I say't,
   For I will not abase my brother!
   No! I would keep him in the realm serene,
   My own ideal of heroes! loved o'er Israel,
   And higher placed by me than all the others!
   And such, for tinkling titles, hollow haloes
   Like that around yon painted brow—thou!</blockquote></div> </div>
