   Long has been ruined its high granite wall;
   And its cupola, sister of the cloud,
   Has now to lowest mire its tall head bowed.
   The herdsman comes to it to choose the stones
   To build a hut, and overturns the bones,
   From which he has just scared a jackal pack,
   Waiting to gnaw them when he turns his back.
   Upon this scene the night is doubly night,
   And the lone passer vainly strains his sight,
   Musing: Was Belus not buried near this spot?
   The royal resting-place is now</blockquote></div> </div>
