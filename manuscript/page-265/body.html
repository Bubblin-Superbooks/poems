</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {VI., May, 1833.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Behold the ball-room flashing on the sight,
   From step to cornice one grand glare of light;
   The noise of mirth and revelry resounds,
   Like fairy melody on haunted grounds.
   But who demands this profuse, wanton glee,
   These shouts prolonged and wild festivity—
   Not sure our city—web, more woe than bliss,
   In any hour, requiring aught but this!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Deaf is the ear of all that jewelled crowd
   To sorrow's sob, although its call be loud.
   Better than waste long</blockquote></div> </div>
