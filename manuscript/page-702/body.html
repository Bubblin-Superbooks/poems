<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">mother, sister, friend—my child!
   My bliss, my wealth, my worship, and my law,
   My Universe! Oh, by all other things
   My soul is tortured. If I should ever lose thee—
   Horrible thought! I cannot utter it.
   Smile, for thy smile is like thy mother's smiling.
   She, too, was fair; you have a trick like her,
   Of passing oft your hand athwart your brow
   As though to clear it. Innocence still loves
   A brow unclouded and an azure eye.
   To me thou seem'st clothed in a holy halo,
   My soul beholds thy soul through thy fair body;
   E'en when my eyes are shut, I see thee still;
   Thou art my daylight, and sometimes I wish
   That Heaven had made me blind that thou might'st be
   The sun that lighted up the world for me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   FANNY KEMBLE-BUTLER.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
