     For now, when smiles are rarely deemed sincere,
   In vain the sceptic bids his doubts depart—

     A mystic age, resembling twilight gloom,
   Wherein we smile at birth, or bear along,
     With noiseless steps, a victim to the tomb!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   G.W.M. REYNOLDS</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
