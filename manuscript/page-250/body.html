<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Of second childhood's proselytes—are there;—
 And the most gaudy in that spacious hall,
 Are e'er the young, or oldest of them all
 Helmet and banner, ornament and crest,
 The lion rampant, and the jewelled vest,
 The silver star that glitters fair and white,
 The arms that tell of many a nation's might—
 Heraldic blazonry, ancestral pride,
 And all mankind invents for pomp beside,
 The wing�d leopard, and the eagle wild—
 All these encircle woman, chief and child;
 Shine on the carpet burying their feet,
 Adorn the dishes that contain their meat;
 And hang upon the drapery, which around
 Falls from the lofty ceiling to the ground,
 Till on the floor its waving fringe is spread,
 As the bird's wing may sweep the roses' bed.—</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Thus is the banquet ruled by Noise and Light,
   Since Light and Noise are foremost on the site.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
