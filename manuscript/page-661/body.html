<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">us upon thy breast;
   Rose-posied pillow, crystallized with spray,
   Where pools pellucid mirror sunny ray.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   A frigate fretting yonder smoothest sky,
     Like pauseless petrel poising o'er a wreck,
   Strikes bright athwart the dearly dazzled eye,
     Until it lessens to scarce certain speck,
   'Neath Venus, sparkling on the agate-sprinkled beach,
     For fisher's sailing-signal, just and true,
     Until Aurora frights her from the view.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In summer, steamer-smoke spreads as thy veil,
     And mists in winter sudden screen thy sight,
   When at thy feet the galley-breakers wail
     And toss their tops high o'er the lofty flight
   Of horrid storm-worn steps with shark-like bite,
   That only ope to swallow up in spite.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
