   For her who, many nights, with anxious care,
     Rocked thy first cradle; who took thy infant soul
   From heaven and gave it to the world; then rife
     With love, still drank herself the gall of life,
   And left for thy young lips the honeyed bowl.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And then—I need it more—then pray for me!
   For she is gentle, artless, true like thee;—
     She has a guileless heart, brow placid still;
   Pity she has for all, envy for none;
   Gentle and wise, she patiently lives on;
     And she endures, nor knows who does the ill.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   In culling flowers, her novice hand has ne'er
