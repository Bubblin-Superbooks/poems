<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Come there, beautiful child, with me,
   Come to the arcades of Araby,
   To the land of the date and the purple vine,
   Where pleasure her rosy wreaths doth twine,
   And gladness shall be alway thine;
   Singing at sunset next thy bed,
   Strewing flowers under thy head.
     Beneath a verdant roof of leaves,
       Arching a flow'ry carpet o'er,
     Thou mayst list to lutes on summer eves
       Their lays of rustic freshness pour,
       While upon the grassy floor
     Light footsteps, in the hour of calm,
     Ruffle the shadow of the palm.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE FAY.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Come to the radiant homes of the blest,
   Where meadows like fountain in light are drest,
   And the grottoes of verdure never decay,
   And the glow of the August dies</blockquote></div> </div>
