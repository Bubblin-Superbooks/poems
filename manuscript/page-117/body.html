   Each roof and home some monstrous mystery bore!
   Which through the world spread like a twofold sore!
   Yet all things slept, and scarce some pale late light
   Flitted along the streets through the still night,
   Lamps of debauch, forgotten and alone,
   The feast's lost fires left there to flicker on;
   The walls' large angles clove the light-lengthening shades
   'Neath the white moon, or on some pool's face played.
   Perchance one heard, faint in the plain beneath,
   The kiss suppressed, the mingling of the breath;
   And the two sister cities, tired of heat,
   In love's embrace lay down in murmurs sweet!
   Whilst sighing winds the scent of sycamore
   From Sodom to Gomorrah softly bore!
   Then over all spread out the blackened cloud,
   "'Tis here!" the Voice on high exclaimed aloud.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
