<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">sculptured sabre, faithful in alarmsâ€”
   The broidered garb, the yataghan, the vest
   Expressive of thy rank, to thee still rest!
   And when thy vessel o'er the foaming sound
   Is proud past storied coasts to blithely bound,
   At once the point of beauty may restore
   Smiles to thy lip, and smoothe thy brow once more.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   G.W.M. REYNOLDS.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
