               Good heaven sends;

               With honey blends;

               When, near to-night,
   She proudly stalked a-past the maids so homely,
               In bodice tight
   And collar old as reign of wicked Julian,
               By fiend beguiled—
   Oh! this chill wind, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
