<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">seemed filled with harmony strange and dire;
   While swarmed around the entire human race
   A future Babel, on the world's whole space
       Fixed its eternal spire.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Up to the zenith rose its lengthening stair,
   While each great granite mountain lent a share
       To form a stepping base;
   Height upon height repeated seemed to rise,
   For pyramid on pyramid the strainï¿½d eyes
       Saw take their ceaseless place.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Through yawning walls huge elephants stalked by;
   Under dark pillars rose a forestry,
       Pillars by madness multiplied;
   As round some giant hive, all day and night,
   Huge vultures, and red eagles' wheeling flight
       Was through each porch descried.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
