<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">We told thirty when we started
     From port so taut and fine,
   But soon our crew were parted,
     Till now we number nine.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Tom Robbins, English, tall and straight,
     Left us at Aetna light;
   He left us to investigate
     What made the mountain bright;
   "I mean to ask Old Nick himself,
     (And here his eye he rolls)
   If I can't bring Newcastle pelf
     By selling him some coals!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In Calabree, a lass and cup
     Drove scowling Spada wild:
   She only held her finger up,
     And there he drank and smiled;
   And over in Ga�ta Bay,
     Ascanio—ashore
   A fool!—must wed a widow gay
     Who'd buried three or four.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
