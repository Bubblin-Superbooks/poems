   To where the table and the da�s are,
   Leaving between their fronts a narrow lane.
   On the left side the Marquises maintain
   Their place, but the right side the Dukes retain,
   And till the roof, embattled by Spignus,
   But worn by time that even that subdues,
   Shall fall upon their heads, these forms will stand
   The grades confronting—one on either hand.
   While in advance beyond, with haughty head—
   As if commander of this squadron dread—
   All waiting signal of the Judgment Day,
   In stone was seen in olden sculptors' way
   Charlemagne the King, who on the earth had found
   Only twelve knights to grace his Table Round.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
