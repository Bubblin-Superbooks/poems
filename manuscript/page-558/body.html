<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   What did the greatest king that e'er earth bore,
   Sennacherib? No matter—he's no more!
   What were the words Sardanapalus said?
   Who cares to hear—that ruler long is dead.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   The Soudan, turning pale, stared at the TEN aghast.
     "Before to-morrow's night," he said, "in dust to rest,
   These walls with croaking images shall be downcast;
     I will not have fiends speak when angels are addressed."
   But while Zim at the Sphinxes clenched his hand and shook,
     The cup in which it seems the rich wine sweetly breathes,
   The cup with jewels sparkling, met his lowered look,
     Dwelling on the rim which the rippling wine enwreathes.
   "Ha! You!" Zim cried, "have often cleared my heated head
     Of heavy thoughts which your great lord have come to seek
   And torture with their pain and weight like molten lead.
