     Thyself even hast the strong
   Thrill of divinity
     Mingled with thy small song.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Each grand old warrior

   Mute thunders at thy door
     Sleep, that shall wake most loud.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Around thee foams the wild
     Bright sea, the lot of kings.
   Happier wert thou, my child,
