   The Christmas log in winter stern,
     While merry plays go round;
   Or streamlets laugh to breeze of May
   That shakes the leaf to break away—
     A shadow falling to the ground.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   If some poor man with hungry eyes
   Her baby's coral bauble spies,
     She marks his look with famine wild,
   For Christ's dear sake she makes with joy
   An alms-gift of the silver toy—
     A smiling angel of the child.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Dublin University Magazine</em>
