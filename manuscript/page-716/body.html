   His hair is black—his eyes shine forth like <em>thine</em>.
   Him thou might'st look upon, and say, fair youth,
   Then turn to me, and think that I am old.
   And yet the light and giddy souls of cavaliers
   Harbor no love so fervent as their words bespeak.
   Let some poor maiden love them and believe them,
   Then die for them—they smile. Aye! these young birds,
   With gay and glittering wing and amorous song,
   Can shed their love as lightly as their plumage.
   The old, whose voice and colors age has dimmed,
   Flatter no more, and, though less fair, are faithful.
   When <em>we</em> love, we love true. Are our steps frail?
   Our eyes dried up and withered? Are our brows
   Wrinkled? There are no wrinkles in the heart.
   Ah! when the graybeard loves, he should be spared;
   The heart is young—<em>that</em> bleeds unto the last.
   I love thee as a spouse,—and in a thousand
   Other fashions,—as sire,—as we love
