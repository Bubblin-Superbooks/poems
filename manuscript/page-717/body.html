   Ah me! when day by day I gaze upon thee,
   Thy graceful step, thy purely-polished brow,
   Thine eyes' calm fire,—I feel my heart leap up,
   And an eternal sunshine bathe my soul.
   And think, too! Even the world admires,
   When age, expiring, for a moment totters
   Upon the marble margin of a tomb,
   To see a wife—a pure and dove-like angel—
   Watch over him, soothe him, and endure awhile
   The useless old man, only fit to die;
   A sacred task, and worthy of all honor,
   This latest effort of a faithful heart;
   Which, in his parting hour, consoles the dying,
   And, without loving, wears the look of love.
   Ah! thou wilt be to me this sheltering angel,
   To cheer the old man's heart—to share with him
   The burden of his evil years;—a daughter
   In thy respect, a sister in thy pity.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code></blockquote></div> </div>
