     The board that groans with shame and plate,
   Still fawning to the sham-crowned head
     That hopes front brazen turneth fate!
   Drink till the comer last is full,
   And never hear in revels' lull,
   Grim Vengeance forging arrows fleet,
         Whilst I gnaw at the crust
         Of Exile in the dust—
   But <em>Honor</em> makes it sweet!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Ye cheaters in the tricksters' fane,
