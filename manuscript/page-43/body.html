   What pangs, what miseries, each day were mine;
   And when I wept there was no mother near
   To soothe my cries, and smile away my tear.
   Poor victim of a punishment unending,
     Torn like a sapling from its mother earth,
   So young, I could not tell what crime impending
     Had stained me from my birth.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Yet far off in dim memory it seems,
   With all its horror mingled happy dreams,
   Strange cries of glory rocked my sleeping head,
   And a glad people watched beside my bed.
   One day into mysterious darkness thrown,
     I saw the promise of my future close;
   I was a little child, left all alone,
     Alas! and I had foes.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
