 Who throng around, each with his diadem—
 Each seated on proud throne—but, lesson vain!
 Each sceptre holds its master with a chain!
 Thus hope of flight were futile from that hall,
 Where chiefest guest was most enslaved of all!
 The godlike-making draught that fires the soul
 The Love—sweet poison-honey—past control,
 (Formed of the sexual breath—an idle name,
 Offspring of Fancy and a nervous frame)—
 Pleasure, mad daughter of the darksome Night,
 Whose languid eye flames when is fading light—
 The gallant chases where a man is borne
 By stalwart charger, to the sounding horn—
 The sheeny silk, the bed of leaves of rose,
 Made more to soothe the sight than court repose;
