   He recognized me—nay, knew me right well,
   And in my face would laugh—and that child-laugh,
   Oh, poor old man! 'twas sunlight to my heart.
   I meant him for a soldier, ay, a conqueror,
   And named him George. One day—oh, bitter thought!
   The child played in the fields. When thou art mother,
   Ne'er let thy children out of sight to play!
   The gypsies took him from me—oh, for what?
   Perhaps to kill him at a witch's rite.
   I weep!—now, after twenty years—I weep
   As if 'twere yesterday. I loved him so!
   I used to call him "my own little king!"
   I was intoxicated with my joy
   When o'er my white beard ran his rosy hands,
   Thrilling me all through.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Foreign Quarterly Review.</em>
