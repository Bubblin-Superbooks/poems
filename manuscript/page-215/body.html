</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XX., November, 1831.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In the dusky nook,
     Near the altar laid,
   Sleeps the child in shadow
     Of his mother's bed:
   Softly he reposes,
   And his lid of roses,
   Closed to earth, uncloses
     On the heaven o'erhead.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Many a dream is with him,
     Fresh from fairyland,
   Spangled o'er with diamonds
     Seems the ocean sand;
   Suns are flaming there,
   Troops of ladies fair
   Souls of infants bear
     In each charming hand.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
