<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Whose names are registered in the hangman's book?
   Whose hearts are ever eager as their swords,
   Edged by a personal impulse of revenge?
   Will you become the queen, dear, of my band?
   Will you become a hunted outlaw's bride?
   When all Spain else pursued and banished me,—
   In her proud forests and air-piercing mountains,
   And rocks the lordly eagle only knew,
   Old Catalonia took me to her bosom.
   Among her mountaineers, free, poor, and brave,
   I ripened into manhood, and, to-morrow,
   One blast upon my horn, among her hills,
   Would draw three thousand of her sons around me.
   You shudder,—think upon it. Will you tread
   The shores, woods, mountains, with me, among men
   Like the dark spirits of your haunted dreams,—
   Suspect all eyes, all voices, every footstep,—
   Sleep on the grass, drink of the torrent, hear
   By night the sharp hiss of the musket-ball
   Whistling too near</blockquote></div> </div>
