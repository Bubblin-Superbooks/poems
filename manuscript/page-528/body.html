   Your hour has sounded, nothing now indeed
   Can change for you the destiny decreed,
   Irrevocable quite. Yes, I looked on.
   Ah! little did you think that any one
   To this unwholesome gloom could knowledge bring
   That Joss a kaiser was, and Zeno king.
   You spoke just now—but why?—too late to plead.
   The forfeit's due and hope should all be dead.
   Incurables! For you I am the grave.
   Oh, miserable men! that naught can save.
   Yes, Sigismond a kaiser is, and you
   A king, O Ladisl�us!—it is true.
   You thought of God but as a wheel to roll
   Your chariot on; you who have king's control
   O'er Poland and its many towns so strong.
   You, Milan's Duke, to whom at once belong
   The gold and iron crowns. You, Emperor made
   By Rome, a son of Hercules 'tis said;
   And you of Spartibor. And your two crowns
   Are shining lights; and yet your shadow frowns
   From every mountain land</blockquote></div> </div>
