   Muse Indignation! haste, and help
     My building up before this roseate realm,

     Whence transient shame Right's prophets overwhelm,
   So many pillories, deserved!
     That eyes to come will pry without avail,
   Upon the wood impenetrant,
     And spy no glimmer of its tarnished tale.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
