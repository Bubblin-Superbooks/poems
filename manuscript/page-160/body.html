         Or sultana,
   Amber should be always mixt
     In my bath of jewelled stone,
         Near my throne,
   Griffins twain of gold betwixt.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Then my hammock should be silk,
         White as milk;
   And, more soft than down of dove,
     Velvet cushions where I sit
         Should emit
   Perfumes that inspire love.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Then should I, no danger near,
         Free from fear,
   Revel in my garden's stream;
     Nor amid the shadows deep
         Dread the peep,
   Of two dark eyes' kindling gleam.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "He who thus would play the spy,
         On the die
   For such sight his head must throw;
     In his blood the sabre naked
         Would be slakï¿½d,
   Of my slaves of ebon brow.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
