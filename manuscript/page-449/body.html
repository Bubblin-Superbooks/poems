   But the dull tide of Darkness, and her dumb
   And fearful shudder. "'Tis the tomb," he said,
   "God is beyond!" Three steps he took, then cried:
   'Twas deathly as the grave, and not a voice
   Responded, nor came any breath to sway
   The snowy mantle, with unsullied white
   Emboldening the spectral wanderer.
   Sudden he marked how, like a gloomy star,
   A spot grew broad upon his livid robe;
   Slowly it widened, raying darkness forth;
   And Canute proved it with his spectral hands
   It was a drop of blood.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>R. GARNETT.</em>
