<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">for the noble race
   Of Poitiers, spotless for a thousand years,
   You, Francis of Valois, without one spark
   Of love or pity, honor or remorse,
   Did on that night (thy couch her virtue's tomb),
   With cold embraces, foully bring to scorn
   My helpless daughter, Dian of Poitiers.
   To save her father's life a knight she sought,
   Like Bayard, fearless and without reproach.
   She found a heartless king, who sold the boon,
   Making cold bargain for his child's dishonor.
   Oh! monstrous traffic! foully hast thou done!
   My blood was thine, and justly, tho' it springs
   Amongst the best and noblest names of France;
   But to pretend to spare these poor gray locks,
   And yet to trample on a weeping woman,
   Was basely done; the father was thine own,
   But not the daughter!—thou hast overpassed
   The right of monarchs!—yet 'tis mercy deemed.
   And I perchance am called ungrateful still.
   Oh, hadst thou come within my dungeon</blockquote></div> </div>
