   Where lilacs and the almond stand
   Behind fields flowering to the strand—
               But no!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Can I—oh, father, mother, crave
   Another final blessing save
   To rest my head upon your grave?—
               But no!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In the one pit where ye repose,
   Would I could tell of France's woes,
   My brethren, who fell facing foes—
               But no!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
