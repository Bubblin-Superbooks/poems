   A stray spirit,
   Or woman fair?
     Sombre yet soft the brow!
     Bow, nations, bow;
   O soul in air,
     Speak—what art thou?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In grief the fair face seems—
   What means those sudden gleams?
   Our antique pride from dreams
   Starts up, and beams
   Its conquering glance,—
   To make our sad hearts dance,
   And wake in woods hushed long
   The wild bird's song.
   Angel of Day!
   Our Hope, Love, Stay,
   Thy countenance
     Lights land and sea
     Eternally,
   Thy name is France
     Or Verity.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Fair angel in thy glass
   When vile things move or pass,
