       Of the air his steed assumes;
   His proud neck swells, his glad hoofs prance,
   And on his head unceasing dance,
       In a gorgeous tuft, red plumes!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Be quick, my sisters! dress in haste!
       Come, see him bear the bell,
   With laurels decked, with true love graced,
   While in his bold hands, fitly placed,
       The bounding cymbals swell!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Mark well the mantle that he'll wear,
       Embroidered by his bride!
   Admire his burnished helmet's glare,
   O'ershadowed by the dark horsehair
       That waves in jet folds wide!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
