<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">man feels all his energies decline,
   His projects gone, himself tomb'd with the dead,
     Where virtues lie, nor more illusions shine,
   When all our lofty thoughts dispersed and o'er,
     We count within our hearts so near congealed,
   Each grief that's past, each dream, exhausted ore!
     As counting dead upon the battle-field.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   As one who walks by the lamp's flickering blaze,
     Far from the hum of men, the joys of earthâ€”
   Our mind arrives at last by tortuous ways,
     At that drear gulf where but despair has birth.
   E'en there, amid the darkness of that night,
     When all seems closing round in empty air,
   Is seen through thickening gloom one trembling light!
     'Tis Love's sweet memory that lingers there!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
