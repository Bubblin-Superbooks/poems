     Wild flowers of the glen,
   Caves swoll'n with shadow, where sunshine
     Has pierced not, far from men;
   Ye sacred hills and antique rocks,
     Ye oaks that worsted time,
   Ye limpid lakes which snow-slide shocks
     Hurl up in storms sublime;
   And sky above, unruflfed blue,
     Chaste rills that alway ran
   From stainless source a course still true,
     What think ye of this man?</p></blockquote></div> </div>
