<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">thunderbolts I rest my arm,
     And gods might wish my exploits with them were their own.
   I live—I am not open to the points of harm,
     And e'en my throne will be with age an altar-stone.
   When the time comes for me to cast off earthly robe,
     And enter—being Day—into the realms of light,
   The gods will say, we call Zizimi from his globe
     That we may have our brother nearer to our sight!
   Glory is but my menial, Pride my own chained slave,
     Humbly standing when Zizimi is in his seat.
   I scorn base man, and have sent thousands to the grave.
     They are but as a rushen carpet to my feet.
   Instead of human beings, eunuchs, blacks, or mutes,
     Be yours, oh, Sphinxes, with the glad names on your fronts!
   The task, with voice attuned to emulate the flute's,
     To charm the king, whose chase is man, and wars his hunts.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
