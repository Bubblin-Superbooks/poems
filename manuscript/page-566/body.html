   All joy, enchantment, perfume, waits she there,
   Heaven in her glance, her very name a prayer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Yet 'neath the sky, and before life and fate,
   Poor child, she feels herself so vaguely great.
   With stately grace she gives her presence high
   To dawn, to spring, to shadows flitting by,
   To the dark sunset glories of the heaven,
   And all the wild magnificence of even;
   On nature waits, eternal and serene,
   With all the graveness of a little queen.
   She never sees a man but on his knee,
   She Duchess of Brabant one day will be,
   Or rule Sardinia, or the Flemish crowd
   She is the Infanta, five years old, and proud.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
