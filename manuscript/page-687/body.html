     Gone down, where witness none, save Night, hath been,
   Ye deep, deep waves, of kneeling mothers feared,
     What dismal tales know ye of things unseen?
     Tales that ye tell your whispering selves between
       The while in clouds to the flood-tide ye pour;
     And this it is that gives you, as I ween,
       Those mournful voices, mournful evermore,
       When ye come in at eve to us who dwell on shore.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
