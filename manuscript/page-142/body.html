<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   To you Bassora offers
     Her respect, and Trebizonde
   Her carpets richly wrought, and spice
     And gems, of which you're fond.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To you the Cyprus temples
     Dare not bar or close the doors;
   For you the mighty Danube sends
     The choicest of its stores.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Fear you the Grecian maidens,
     Pallid lilies of the isles?
   Or the scorching-eyed sand-rover
     From Baalbec's massy piles?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Compared with yours, oh, daughter
    Of King Solomon the grand,
   What are round ebon bosoms,
    High brows from Hellas' strand?</p></blockquote></div> </div>
