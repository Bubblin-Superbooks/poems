   The hue of Rhamesis, black with the gloom.
   A Jailer who ne'er needs bolts, bars, or hasps,
   Is Death. With unawed hand a god he grasps,
   He thrusts, to stiffen, in a narrow case,
   Or cell, where struggling air-blasts constant moan;
   Walling them round with huge, damp, slimy stone;
   And (leaving mem'ry of bloodshed as drink,
   And thoughts of crime as food) he stops each chink.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE NINTH SPHINX.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
