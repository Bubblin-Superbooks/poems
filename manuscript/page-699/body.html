   I would have sued upon my knees for death,
   But mercy for my child, my name, my race,
   Which, once polluted, is my race no more.
   Rather than insult, death to them and me.
   I come not now to ask her back from thee;
   Nay, let her love thee with insensate love;
   I take back naught that bears the brand of shame.
   Keep her! Yet, still, amidst thy festivals,
   Until some father's, brother's, husband's hand
   ('Twill come to pass!) shall rid us of thy yoke,
   My pallid face shall ever haunt thee there,
   To tell thee, Francis, it was foully done!...</p></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code> TRIBOULET _(the Court Jester), sneering._ The poor man</code></pre>
