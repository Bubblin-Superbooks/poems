</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XX. a, December, 1834.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Morning glances hither,
     Now the shade is past;
   Dream and fog fly thither
     Where Night goes at last;
   Open eyes and roses
   As the darkness closes;
   And the sound that grows is
     Nature walking fast.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Murmuring all and singing,
     Hark! the news is stirred,
   Roof and creepers clinging,
     Smoke and nest of bird;
   Winds to oak-trees bear it,
   Streams and fountains hear it,
   Every breath and spirit
     As a voice is heard.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
