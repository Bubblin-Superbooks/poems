     Will to the wanton sorc'ress say, "Begone!
   Respect the cypress on my mournful brow,
   Lost Happiness hath left regret—but <em>thou</em>
     Leavest remorse, alone."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Yet, haply lest I check the mounting fire,
     O friends, that in your revelry appears!
   With you I'll breathe the air which ye respire,
   And, smiling, hide my melancholy lyre
     When it is wet with tears.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Each in his secret heart perchance doth own
     Some fond regret 'neath passing smiles concealed;—
   Sufferers alike together and alone
   Are we; with many a grief to others known,
     How many unrevealed!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
