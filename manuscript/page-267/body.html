<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">all lots appear;
   For blinded by the sun of bliss your eyes
   Can see no dark horizon to the skies.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Such is the chance of life! Each gallant thane,
   Prince, peer, and noble, follow in your train;â€”
   They praise your loveliness, and in your ear
   They whisper pleasing things, but insincere;
   Thus, as the moths enamoured of the light,
   Ye seek these realms of revelry each night.
   But as ye travel thither, did ye know
   What wretches walk the streets through which you go.
   Sisters, whose gewgaws glitter in the glare
   Of your great lustre, all expectant there,
   Watching the passing crowd with avid eye,
   Till one their love, or lust, or shame may buy;
   Or, with commingling jealousy and rage,
   They mark the progress of your equipage;
   And their deceitful life essays the while
   To mask their woe beneath a sickly smile!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
