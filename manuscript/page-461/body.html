   And hairy, and seven feet high was he,
   Like John of Bourbon. Roaming hill or wood
   He looked a wolf was striving to do good.
   Bound up in duty, he of naught complained,
   The cry for help his aid at once obtained.
   Only he mourned the baseness of mankind,
   And—that the beds too short he still doth find.
   When people suffer under cruel kings,
   With pity moved, he to them succor brings.
   'Twas he defended Alix from her foes
   As sword of Urraca—he ever shows
   His strength is for the feeble and oppressed;
   Father of orphans he, and all distressed!
   Kings of the Rhine in strongholds were by him
   Boldly attacked, and tyrant barons grim.
   He freed the towns—confronting in his lair
   Hugo the Eagle; boldly did he dare
   To break the collar of Saverne, the ring
   Of Colmar, and the iron torture thing
   Of Schlestadt, and the chain that Haguenau bore.
