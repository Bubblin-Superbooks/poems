   Dante dreamt (while spirits pass
   As in wizard's jetty glass)
   Each black-bossed Briarian trunk
   Waved live arms like furies drunk;
   Winsome Will, 'neath Windsor Oak,
   Eyed each elf that cracked a joke
   At poor panting grease-hart fast—
   Obese, roguish Jack harassed;
   At Versailles, Moli�re did court
   Cues from Pan (in heron port,
   Half in ooze, half treeward raised),
   "Words so witty, that Boileau's 'mazed!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Foliage! fondly you attract!
   Dian's faith I keep intact,
   And declare that thy dryads dance
   Still, and will, in thy green expanse!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
