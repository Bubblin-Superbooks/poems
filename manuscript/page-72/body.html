</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Bk. V. xxii., November, 1825.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   That brow, that smile, that cheek so fair,
     Beseem my child, who weeps and plays:
     A heavenly spirit guards her ways,
   From whom she stole that mixture rare.
     Through all her features shining mild,
   The poet sees an angel there,
     The father sees a child.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And by their flame so pure and bright,
     We see how lately those sweet eyes
     Have wandered down from Paradise,
   And still are lingering in its light.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
