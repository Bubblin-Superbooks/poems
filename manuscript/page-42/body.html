   Out of an impure world He calls thee home,
     From the mad earth, where horrid murder waves
       Over the broken cross her impure wings,
     And regicides go down among the graves,
       Scenting the blood of kings."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   He cries: "Then have I finished my long life?
   Are all its evils over, all its strife,
   And will no cruel jailer evermore
   Wake me to pain, this blissful vision o'er?
   Is it no dream that nothing else remains
     Of all my torments but this answered cry,
   And have I had, O God, amid my chains,
     The happiness to die?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
