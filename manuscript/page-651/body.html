   She gazed upon that monster of the wood,
   Whose yellow balls not Typhon had withstood,
   And—well! who knows what thoughts these small heads hold?
   She rose up in her cot—full height, and bold,
   And shook her pink fist angrily at him.
   Whereon—close to the little bed's white rim,
   All dainty silk and laces—this huge brute
   Set down her brother gently at her foot,
   Just as a mother might, and said to her,
   "Don't be put out, now! There he is, dear, there!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   EDWIN ARNOLD, C.S.I.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
