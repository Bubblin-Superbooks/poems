     The church we entered there,
   Where many a weary soul since long ago
     Had past with plaint or prayer.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Mournful and still it was at day's decline,
     The day we entered there;
   As in a loveless heart, at the lone shrine,
     The fires extinguished were.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Scarcely was heard to float some gentlest sound,
     Scarcely some low breathed word,
   As in a forest fallen asleep, is found
     Just one belated bird.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   A STORM SIMILE.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
