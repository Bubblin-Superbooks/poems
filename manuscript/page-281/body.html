     By dewdrops pearly drest,
   Where through all seasons fairies guard
     Flowers by bees carest,
   Where one may gather, day and night,
   Roses, honeysuckle, lily white,
   I fain would make of it a site
     For thy foot to rest.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   If there be a loving heart
     Where Honor rules the breast,
   Loyal and true in every part,
     That changes ne'er molest,
   Eager to run its noble race,
   Intent to do some work</blockquote></div> </div>
