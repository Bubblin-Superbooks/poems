<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">that I must see thee—see thee still—
   See thee for ever. When thy footstep dies,
   It is as if my heart no more would beat;
   When thou art gone, I am absent from myself;
   But when the footstep which I love and long for
   Strikes on mine ear again—then I remember
   I live, and feel my soul return to me.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   G. MOIR.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
