<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Howe'er great is pharaoh, the magi, king,
   Encompassed by an idolizing ring,
   None is so high as Tiglath Pileser.
   Who, like the God before whom pales the star,
   Has temples, with a prophet for a priest,
   Who serves up daily sacrilegious feast.
   His anger there are none who dare provoke,
   His very mildness is looked on as a yoke;
   And under his, more feared than other rules,
   He holds his people bound, like tam�d bulls.
   Asia is banded with his paths of war;
   He is more of a scourge than Attila.
   He triumphs glorious—but, day by day,
   The earth falls at his feet, piecemeal away;
   And the bricks for his tomb's wall, one by one,
   Are being shaped—are baking in the sun.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE THIRD SPHINX.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
