   To leap with hiss of thousand snakes where Tiber writhes and raves.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   All's lost! in jasper, marble, gold, the statues totter—crash!
   Spite of the names divine engraved, they are but dust and ash.
   The victor-scourge sweeps swollen on, whilst north winds sound the horn
   To goad the flies of fire yet beyond the flight forlorn.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Proud capital! farewell for e'er! these flames nought can subdue—
   The Aqueduct of Sylla gleams, a bridge o'er hellish brew.
   'Tis Nero's whim! how good to see Rome brought the lowest down;
   Yet, Queen of all the earth, give thanks for such a splendrous crown!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
