   Breasting already broader waves of life,
   A conscious innocence on either face,
   My pensive daughter and my curious boy.
   Thus do I dream, while the light sailors sing,
   At even moored beneath some steepy shore,
   While the waves opening all their nostrils breathe
   A thousand sea-scents to the wandering wind,
   And the whole air is full of wondrous sounds,
   From sea to strand, from land to sea, given back
   Alone and sad, thus do I dream of you.

   The glowing hearth, and all the pious care
   Of tender mother, and of grandsire kind;
   And while before me, spotted with white sails,
   The limpid ocean mirrors all the stars,
   And while the pilot, from the infinite main,
   Looks with calm eye into the infinite heaven,
   I dreaming of you only, seek to scan
   And fathom all my soul's deep love for you—
   Love sweet,</blockquote></div> </div>
