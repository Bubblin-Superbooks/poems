<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">"I saw her pass beside my lofty station—
             A glance—'twas all!
   And yet I loathe my daily honest ration,
             The air's turned gall!
   My soul's in chase, my body chafes to wander—
             My dagger's filed—
   Oh! this chill wind may change, and o'er the mountain
             May drive me wild!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   HENRY L. WILLIAMS.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
