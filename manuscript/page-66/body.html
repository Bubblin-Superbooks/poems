<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Alas! for natural tears and simple pains,
     For tender recollections, cherished long,
   For guileless griefs, which no compunction stains,
   We blush; as if we wore these earthly chains
     Only for sport and song!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Yes, my blest hours have fled without a trace:
     In vain I strove their parting to delay;
   Brightly they beamed, then left a cheerless space,
   Like an o'erclouded smile, that in the face
     Lightens, and fades away.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Fraser's Magazine</em>
