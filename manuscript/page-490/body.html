   Is representant of some stirring tale.
   Each delta-shaped escutcheon shines to show
   A vision of the chief by it we know.
   Here are the blood-stained Dukes' and Marquis' line,
   Barbaric lords, who amid war's rapine
   Bore gilded saints upon their banners still
   Painted on fishes' skin with cunning skill.
   Here Geth, who to the Slaves cried "Onward go,"
   And Mundiaque and Ottocar—Plato
   And Ladisl�us Kunne; and Welf who bore
   These words upon his shield his foes before;
   "Nothing there is I fear." Otho blear-eyed,
   Zultan and Nazamustus, and beside
   The later Spignus, e'en to Spartibor
   Of triple vision, and yet more and more
   As if a pause at every age were made,
   And Antaeus' fearful dynasty portrayed.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   What do they here so rigid and erect?
