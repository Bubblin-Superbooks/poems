</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XXIV., July 17, 1836.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Hark to that solemn sound!
     It steals towards the strand.—
   Whose is that voice profound
     Which mourns the swallowed land,
             With moans,
             Or groans,
     New threats of ruin close at hand?
   It is Triton—the storm to scorn
   Who doth wind his sonorous horn.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   How thick the rain to-night!
     And all along the coast
