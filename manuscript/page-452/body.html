<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">not ebb nor flow, Canute went on,
   And ever walking, came to a closed door,
   That from beneath showed a mysterious light.
   Then he looked down upon his winding-sheet,
   For that was the great place, the sacred place,
   That was a portion of the light of God,
   And from behind that door Hosannas rang.
   The winding-sheet was red, and Canute stopped.
   This is why Canute from the light of day
   Draws ever back, and hath not dared appear
   Before the Judge whose face is as the sun.
   This is why still remaineth the dark king
   Out in the night, and never having power
   To bring his robe back to its first pure state,
   But feeling at each step a blood-drop fall,
   Wanders eternally 'neath the vast black heaven.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Dublin University Magazine</em>
