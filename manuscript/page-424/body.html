     All our poor imaginings above,
   With the wingï¿½d cherubim for playmates,
     And the good God evermore to love.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Sweet it were to dwell there in all seasons,
     Like a taper burning day and night,
   Near to the child Jesus and the Virgin,
     In that home so beautiful and bright.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   But you should have told him, hapless mother,
     Told your child so frail and gentle too,
   That you were all his in life's beginning,
     But that also he belonged to you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   For the mother watches o'er the infant,
     He must rise up in her latter days,
   She will need the man that was her baby
     To stand by her when her strength decays.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
