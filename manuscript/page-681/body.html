   Their music enticing fond lovers to meet;
   The violets are blooming and nestling their heads
   In richest profusion on moss-coated beds.

               This bright summer day,
             When Nature is fairest
               And all is so gay?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   LEOPOLD WRAY.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
