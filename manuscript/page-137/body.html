       As I came—it was noon, my lords—
   And your sister had then, as she constantly hath,
   Drawn her veil close around her, aware that the path
       Is beset by these foreign hordes.
   But the weight of the noonday's sultry hour
   Near the mosque was so oppressive
   That—forgetting a moment the eye of the Giaour—
       I yielded to th' heat excessive.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   SECOND BROTHER.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Gulnara, make answer! Whom, then, hast thou seen,
   In a turban of white and a caftan of green?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE SISTER.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
