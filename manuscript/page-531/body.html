   To see such cravens with such noble name.
   But let us finish—what has just passed here

   Th' accursed dice that rolled at Calvary
   You rolled a woman's murder to decree
   It was a dark disastrous game to play;
   But not for me a moral to essay.
   This moment to the misty grave is due,

   Not recognizing in the draught you take
   The stench that your atrocities must make.
