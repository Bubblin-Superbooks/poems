   Finds out the honeyed flowers; the eagle flies
   To seek the sun; the vulture where death lies;
     The swallow to the spring; the prayer to Heaven!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And when thy voice is raised to God for me,
   I'm like the slave whom in the vale we see
     Seated to rest, his heavy load laid by;
   I feel refreshed—the load of faults and woe
   Which, groaning, I drag with me as I go,
     Thy wing�d prayer bears off rejoicingly!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Pray for thy father! that his dreams be bright
   With visitings of angel forms of light,
     And his soul burn as incense flaming wide,
   Let thy pure breath all his dark sins efface,
   So that his heart be like that holy place,
     An altar pavement each eve purified!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
