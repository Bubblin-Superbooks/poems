</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XXVII.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Oh! when I sleep, come near my resting-place,
     As Laura came to bless her poet's heart,
   And let thy breath in passing touch my face—
               At once a space
                 My lips will part.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And on my brow where too long weighed supreme
     A vision—haply spent now—black as night,
   Let thy look as a star arise and beam—
               At once my dream
                 Will seem of light.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
