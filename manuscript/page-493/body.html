   Of horrors such as nightmare only brings.
   Asps, and spread eagles without beak or feet,
   Sirens and mermaids here and dragons meet,
   And antlered stags and fabled unicorn,
   And fearful things of monstrous fancy born.
   Upon the rigid form of morion's sheen
   Winged lions and the Cerberus are seen,
   And serpents winged and finned; things made to fright
   The timid foe, alone by sense of sight.
   Some leaning forward and the others back,
   They looked a growing forest that did lack
   No form of terror; but these things of dread
   That once on barons' helms the battle led
   Beneath the giant banners, now are still,</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   As if they gaped and found the time but ill,
   Wearied the ages passed so slowly by,
   And that the gory dead no more did lie
   Beneath their feetâ€”pined for the battle-cry,
