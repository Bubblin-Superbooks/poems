<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">when the rashest knows not best to flee ar stand his ground,
   When not a single war-cry from the sombre mass will rush,
   When o'er the universe is spread by Doubting utter hush,
   Then he who searches well within the walls that close immure
   Our teachers, leaders, heroes slain because they lived too pure,
   May glue his ear upon the ground where few else came to grieve,
   And ask the austere shadows: "Ho! and must one still believe?
   Read yet the orders: 'Forward, march!' and 'charge!'" Then from the lime,
   Which burnt the bones but left the soul (Oh! tyrants' useless crime!)
   Will rise reply: "Yes!" "yes!" and "yes!" the thousand, thousandth time!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   H.L.W.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
