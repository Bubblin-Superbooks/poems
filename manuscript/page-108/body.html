<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Free as the airâ€”their arrows fly
 Swifter than lightning through the sky!
 By them is breathed the purest air,
   Where'er their wanderings may chance!
 Children and maidens young and fair,
   And warriors circling in the dance!
 Upon the beach, around the fire,
 Now quenched by wind, now burning higher,
 Like spirits which our dreams inspire
   To hover o'er our trance.</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code> Virgins, with skins of ebony,
   Beauteous as evening skies,
 Laughed as their forms they dimly see
   In metal mirrors rise;
 Others, as joyously as they,
 Were drawing for their food by day,
 With jet-black hands, white camels' whey,
   Camels with docile eyes.</code></pre></blockquote></div> </div>
