<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">voluptuous couch, while Falernian wine
           Fill'd his cup to the brim!
   Dulcet music of Greece, Asiatic repose,
   Spicy fragrance of Araby, Italian rose,
           All united for him!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Every luxury known through the earth's wide expanse,
   In profusion procured was put forth to enhance
           The repast that they gave;
   And no Sybarite, nursed in the lap of delight,
   Such a banquet ere tasted as welcomed that night
           The elect of the grave.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And the lion, meantime, shook his ponderous chain,
   Loud and fierce howled the tiger, impatient to stain
           The bloodthirsty arena;
   Whilst the women of Rome, who applauded those deeds
   And who hailed the forthcoming enjoyment, must needs
           Shame the restless hyena.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
