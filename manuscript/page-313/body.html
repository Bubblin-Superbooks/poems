   In corners made by old books dim;
   The long-backed dwarfs, those goblins grim
   That seem at home 'mong vases rare,
   And chat to them with friendly air—
   Oh, how the joyous demon throng
   Must all have laughed with laughter long
   To see you on my rough drafts fall,
   My bald hexameters, and all

   And drag them with relentless hand
   From out their box, with true delight
   To set them each and all a-light,
   And then with clapping hands to lean
   Above the stove and watch the scene,
   How to the mass deformed there came
   A soul that showed itself in flame!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Bright tricksy children—oh, I pray
