   What more was written on the Future's scroll?
   Was this an expiation? It must be, yea!
   He turned to God for one enlightening ray.
   "Is this the vengeance, Lord of Hosts?" he sighed,
   But the first murmur on his parched lips died.
   "Is this the vengeance? Must my glory set?"
   A pause: his name was called; of flame a jet
   Sprang in the darkness;â€”a Voice answered; "No!
   Not yet."</p></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code>           Outside still fell the smothering snow.</code></pre>

   It was the vulture's, but how like the <em>sea-bird's scream.</em>
