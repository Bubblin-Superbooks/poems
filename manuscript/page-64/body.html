</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Bk. V. ii., February, 1821.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Yes, Happiness hath left me soon behind!
     Alas! we all pursue its steps! and when
   We've sunk to rest within its arms entwined,
   Like the Phoenician virgin, wake, and find
     Ourselves alone again.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Then, through the distant future's boundless space,
     We seek the lost companion of our days:
   "Return, return!" we cry, and lo, apace
   Pleasure appears! but not to fill the place
     Of that we mourn always.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
