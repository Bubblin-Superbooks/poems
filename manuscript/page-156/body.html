       Where fiercely the hand of Lust came.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Soft and sweet urchin, still red with the lash
   Of rein and of scabbard of wild Kuzzilbash,
       What lack you for changing your sob—
   If not unto laughter beseeming a child—
   To utterance milder, though they have defiled
       The graves which they shrank not to rob?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Would'st thou a trinket, a flower, or scarf,
   Would'st thou have silver? I'm ready with half
       These sequins a-shine in the sun!
   Still more have I money—if you'll but speak!"
   He spoke: and furious the cry of the Greek,
       "Oh, give me your dagger and gun!"</p></blockquote></div> </div>
