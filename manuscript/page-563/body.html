     The richly carved and golden Lamp, whose light went outâ€”
   Then glided in a form strange-shaped,
     In likeness of a woman, moulded in dense smoke,
   Veiled in thick, ebon fog, in utter darkness draped,
     A glimpse of which, in short, one's inmost fears awoke.
   Zim was alone with her, this Goddess of the Night.
     The massy walls of stone like vapor part and fade,
   Zim, shuddering, tried to call guard or satellite,
     But as the figure grasped him firmly, "Come!" she said.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   BP. ALEXANDER</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   A QUEEN FIVE SUMMERS OLD.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
