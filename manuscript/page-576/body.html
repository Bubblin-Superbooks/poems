   I have a lass (I said it pat)
     Who's not been bred like nun—
   But, merry maid with eagle eye,
     It's proud she smiles and bright,
   And sings upon the cliff, to spy
     My ship a-heave in sight!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   My Faenzetta has my heart!
     In Fieson� she
   The fairest! Nothing shall us part,
     Saving, in sooth, the Sea!
   And that not long! its rolling wave
     And such breeze holding now
   Will send me along to her I love—
     And so I made my bow.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   We told thirty when we started
     From port so taut and fine,
   But thus our crew were parted,
     And now we number nine.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
