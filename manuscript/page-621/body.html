         If I, one day, behold
   You pass from out our dull air to the light,
         You, infant—I, so old:
   If I the thread of our two lives must see
         Thus blent to human view,
   I who would fain know death was near to me,
         And far away for you;
   If your small hands remain such fragile things;
         If, in your cradle stirred,
   You have the mien of waiting there for wings,
         Like to some new-fledged bird;
   Not rooted to our earth</blockquote></div> </div>
