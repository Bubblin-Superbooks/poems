<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">happiness and goodness too,
   Caressed by destiny are you,
     Charming you are, if you but play.
   But we with living overwrought,
   And full of grave and sombre thought,
   Are snappish oft: dear little men,
   We have ill-tempered days, and then,
   Are quite unjust and full of care;
   It rained this morning and the air
   Was chill; but clouds that dimm'd the sky
   Have passed. Things spited me, and why?
   But now my heart repents. Behold
   What 'twas that made me cross, and scold!
   All by-and-by you'll understand,
   When brows are mark'd by Time's stern hand;
   Then you will comprehend, be sure,
   When older—that's to say, less pure.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   The fault I freely own was mine.
   But oh, for pardon now I pine!
   Enough my punishment to meet,
   You must forgive, I do entreat
   With clasped hands praying—oh, come back,
   Make peace, and you shall nothing lack.
