</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {LA PITI� SUPREME VIII., 1881.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   When an angel of kindness
     Saw, doomed to the dark,
   Men framed in his likeness,
     He sought for a spark—
   Stray gem of God's glory
         That shines so serene—
     And, falling like lark,
   To brighten our story,
         Pure Pity was seen.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
