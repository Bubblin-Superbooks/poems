<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">passing hounds snuff out your lair!
   Listen at eventide on lonesome path
   For traveller's footfall, or the mule-bell's chime,
   Pouncing by hundreds on one helpless man,
   To cut him down, then back to your retreatsâ€”
   <em>You</em> dare to vaunt your sires? I call your sires,
   Bravest of brave and greatest 'mid the great,
   A line of warriors! you, a pack of thieves!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Athenaeum</em>.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
