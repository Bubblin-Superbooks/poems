<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">rest in my loving arms!
     Let there be no regrets and no farewell!
       Here of thy mother sweet, where waters flow,
       Here of thy fatherland we whispered low;
         Here, music, praise, and prayer
         Filled the glad summer air.
               Can I forget?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Forget? My dear old home must I forget?
     And wander forth and hear my people weep,
   Far from the woods where, when the sun has set,
     Fearless but weary to thy arms I creep;
       Far from lush flow'rets and the palm-tree's moan
       I could not live. Here let me rest alone!
         Go! I must follow nigh,
         With thee I'm doomed to die,
               Never forget!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
