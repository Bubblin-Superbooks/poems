   To help the indigent and raise the low—
   To train the wicked to forsake his way,
   And find th' industrious work from day to day!
   Better to charity those hours afford,
   Which now are wasted at the festal board!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   And ye, O high-born beauties! in whose soul
   Virtue resides, and Vice has no control;
   Ye whom prosperity forbids to sin,
   So fair without—so chaste, so pure within—
   Whose honor Want ne'er threatened to betray,
   Whose eyes are joyous, and whose heart is gay;
   Around whose modesty a hundred arms,
   Aided by pride, protect a thousand charms;
   For you this ball is pregnant with delight;
   As glitt'ring planets cheer the gloomy night:—
   But, O, ye wist not, while your souls are glad,
   How millions wander, homeless, sick and sad!
   Hazard has placed you in a happy sphere,
   And like your own to you</blockquote></div> </div>
