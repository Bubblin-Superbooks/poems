   Then Zeno stooped and lifted from the ground
   An edge of carpetâ€”groped until he found
   A ring, which, pulled, an opening did disclose,
   With deep abyss beneath; from it there rose
   The odor rank of crime. Joss walked to see
   While Zeno pointed to it silently.
   But eyes met eyes, and Joss, well pleased, was fain
   By nod of head to make approval plain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   XV.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE OUBLIETTES.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   If sulphurous light had shone from this vile well
