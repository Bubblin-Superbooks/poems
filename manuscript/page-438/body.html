     A stream may be; he did not grudge a stook.
     When the poor gleaner passed, with kindly look,
   Quoth he, "Of purpose let some handfuls fall."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   He walked his way of life straight on and plain,
     With justice clothed, like linen white and clean,
     And ever rustling towards the poor, I ween,
   Like public fountains ran his sacks of grain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Good master, faithful friend, in his estate
     Frugal yet generous, beyond the youth
     He won regard of woman, for in sooth
   The young man may be fairâ€”the old man's great.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
