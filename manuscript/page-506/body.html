   A grinning demon might be clearly seen.
   April has flowers where lurk the slugs between.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Big Joss and little Zeno, pray come here;
   Look nowâ€”how dreadful! can I help but fear!"
   Madame Mahaud was speaker. Moonlight there
   Caressingly enhanced her beauty rare,
   Making it shine and tremble, as if she
   So soft and gentle were of things that be
   Of air created, and are brought and ta'en
   By heavenly flashes. Now, she spoke again
   "Certes, 'tis heavy purchase of a throne,
   To pass the night here utterly alone.
   Had you not slyly come to guard me now,
   I should have died of fright outright I know."
   The moonbeams through the open door did fall,
   And shine upon the figure next the wall.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
