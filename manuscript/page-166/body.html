<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   On the pinions of air I would fly, I would rush
     Thro' the glens and the valleys to quiver;
   Past the mountain ravine, past the grove's dreamy hush,
     And the murmuring fall of the river.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   By the darkening hollow and bramble-bush lane,
     To catch the sweet breath of the roses;
   Past the land would I speed, where the sand-driven plain
     'Neath the heat of the noonday reposes.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Past the rocks that uprear their tall forms to the sky,
     Whence the storm-fiend his anger is pouring;
   Past lakes that lie dead, tho' the tempest roll nigh,
     And the turbulent whirlwind be roaring.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
