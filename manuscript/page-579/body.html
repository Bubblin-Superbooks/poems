<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Their country free and joyous—
       She of the rugged sides—
   She of the rough peaks arrogant
       Whereon the tempest rides:
   Mother of the unconquered thought
       And of the savage form,
   Who brings out of her sturdy heart
       The hero and the storm:
   Who giveth freedom unto man,
       And life unto the beast;
   Who hears her silver torrents ring
       Like joy-bells at a feast;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Who hath her caves for palaces,
       And where her ch�lets stand—
   The proud, old archer of Altorf,
       With his good bow in his hand.
   Is she to suckle jailers?
       Shall shame and glory rest,
   Amid her lakes and glaciers,
       Like twins upon her breast?
   Shall the two-headed eagle,
       Marked with her double blow,
   Drink of her milk through all those hearts
       Whose blood he bids to flow?</p></blockquote></div> </div>
