 Fleeting through night's rayless region,
   Hither they return no more.
 Clanking chains and sounds of woe
 Fill the forests as they go;
 And the tall oaks cower low,
   Bent their flaming light before.</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code> On! on! the storm of wings
   Bears far the fiery fear,
 Till scarce the breeze now brings
   Dim murmurings to the ear;
 Like locusts' humming hail,
 Or thrash of tiny flail
 Plied by the fitful gale
   On some old roof-tree sere.</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>     Fainter now are borne
