</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {June, 1828.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   See, where on high the moving masses, piled
   By the wind, break in groups grotesque and wild,
         Present strange shapes to view;
   Oft flares a pallid flash from out their shrouds,
   As though some air-born giant 'mid the clouds
         Sudden his falchion drew.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
