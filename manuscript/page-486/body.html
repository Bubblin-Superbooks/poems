   Or table lone with stately da�s near—
   Two rows of arches o'er a colonnade
   With knights on horseback all in mail arrayed,
   Each one disposed with pillar at his back
   And to another vis-�-vis. Nor lack
   The fittings all complete; in each right hand
   A lance is seen; the armored horses stand
   With chamfrons laced, and harness buckled sure;
   The cuissarts' studs are by their clamps secure;
   The dirks stand out upon the saddle-bow;
   Even unto the horses' feet do flow
   Caparisons,—the leather all well clasped,
   The gorget and the spurs with bronze tongues hasped,
   The shining long sword from the saddle hung,
   The battle-axe across the back was flung.
   Under the arm a trusty dagger rests,
   Each spiked knee-piece its murderous power attests.
   Feet press the stirrups—hands on bridle shown
   Proclaim all ready, with the visors down,
   And yet they stir not, nor is audible
   A sound to</blockquote></div> </div>
