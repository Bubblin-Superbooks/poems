<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">high";—God's sake!
   It's monstrous, horrible! One sees quite clear
   Society—our charge—must shake with fear,
   And shriek for help, and call on us to act
   When there's a hero, taken in the fact.
   If Light shines in the dark, there's guilt in that!
   What's viler than a lantern to a bat?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   III.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Your Garibaldi missed the mark! You see
   The end of life's to cheat, and not to be
   Cheated: The knave is nobler than the fool!
   Get all you can and keep it! Life's a pool,
   The best luck wins; if Virtue starves in rags,
   I laugh at Virtue; here's my money-bags!
   Here's righteous metal! We have kings, I say,
   To keep cash going, and the game at play;
   There's why a king wants money—he'd be missed
