   Say did they numb thy soul, that thou didst sleep?
   Alas! sad France is grown a cave for sleeping,
   Which a worse night than Midnight holds in keeping,
   Thou sleepest sottish—lost to life and fame—
   While the stars stare on thee, and pale for shame.
   Stir! rouse thee! Sit! if thou know'st not to rise;
   Sit up, thou tortured sluggard! ope thine eyes!
   Stretch thy brawn, Giant! Sleep is foul and vile!
   Art fagged, art deaf, art dumb? art blind this while?
   They lie who say so! Thou dost know and feel
   The things they do to thee and thine. The heel
   That scratched thy neck in passing—whose? Canst say?
   Yes, yes, 'twas <em>his</em>, and this is his <em>f�te-day</em>.
   Oh, thou that wert of humankind—couched so—
   A beast of burden on this dunghill! oh!
   Bray to them, Mule! Oh, Bullock! bellow then!
   Since they have made thee blind, grope in thy den!
   Do something, Outcast One, that wast so grand!
