   The tearful roses—lo, the little lovers—
   That kiss the buds and all the flutterings
   In jasmine bloom, and privet, of white wings
   That go and come, and fly, and peep, and hide
   With muffled music, murmured far and wide!
   Ah, Springtime, when we think of all the lays
   That dreamy lovers send to dreamy Mays,
   Of the proud hearts within a billet bound,
   Of all the soft silk paper that men wound,
