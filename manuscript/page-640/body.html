         How came it, that for me,
   Who every pity feel for every woe,
         So vast a gloom could be.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I'll know why night relentless holds me, why
         So great a pile of doom:
   Why endless frost enfolds me, and methinks
         My nightly bed's a tomb:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Why all these battles, all these tears, regrets,
         And sorrows were my share;
   And why God's will of me a cypress made,
         When roses bright ye were.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   MARWOOD TUCKER.</p></blockquote><p>TO THE CANNON "VICTOR HUGO."</p></div> </div>
