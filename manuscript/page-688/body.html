</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {OPERA OF "ESMERALDA," ACT IV., 1836.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Phoebus, is there not this side the grave,
               Power to save
   Those who're loving? Magic balm
   That will restore to me my former calm?
   Is there nothing tearful eye
   Can e'er dry, or hush the sigh?
   I pray Heaven day and night,
   As I lay me down in fright,
   To retake my life, or give
   All again for which I'd live!
   Phoebus, hasten from the shining sphere
               To me here!
   Hither hasten, bring me Death; then Love
   May let our spirits rise, ever-linked, above!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
