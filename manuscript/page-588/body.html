     To the dark thought that haunts us as we roam.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Janet is sad: her husband is alone,
     Wrapped in the black shroud of this bitter night:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   His children are so little, there is none
     To give him aid. "Were they but old, they might."
   Ah, mother! when they too are on the main,
   How wilt thou weep: "Would they were young again!"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   She takes his lantern—'tis his hour at last
     She will go forth, and see if the day breaks,
   And if his signal-fire be at the mast;
     Ah, no—not yet—no breath of morning wakes.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
