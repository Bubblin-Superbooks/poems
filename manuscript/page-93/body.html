<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">now, our horses slain,
   Yet we advance—more courage show,
   Though stricken, seek to overthrow
   The victor-knights who tread in mud
     The writhing slaves who bite the heel,
     While on caparisons of steel
   The maces thunder—cudgels thud!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Should daggers fail hide-coats to shred,
   Seize each your man and hug him dead!
   Who falls unslain will only make
   A mouthful to the wolves who slake
   Their month-whet thirst.  No captives, none!
     We die or win! but should we die,
     The lopped-off hand will wave on high
   The broken brand to hail the sun!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
