             Grew in my mind
   Till I was Caesar—she that crown�d leopard
             He crouched behind,
   No Roman stern, but in her silken leashes
             A captive mild—
   Oh! this chill wind, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "Yet dance and sing, tho' night be thickly falling;—
             In selfsame time
   Poor Sabine heard in ecstasy the calling,
             In winning rhyme,
   Of Saldane's earl so noble, ay, and wealthy,
             Name e'er reviled—
   Oh! this chill wind, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "(Let me upon this bench be shortly resting,
             So weary, I!)
   That noble bore her smiling, unresisting,
             By yonder high
   And ragged road that snakes towards the summit
             Where crags are piled—
   Oh! this chill wind, etc.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
