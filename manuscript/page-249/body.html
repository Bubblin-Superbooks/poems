 The feast to pampered palate gives delight—
 The sated guests pick at the spicy food,
 And drink profusely, for the cheer is good;
 And at that table—where the wise are few—
 Both sexes and all ages meet the view;
 The sturdy warrior with a thoughtful face—
 The am'rous youth, the maid replete with grace,
 The prattling infant, and the hoary hair
