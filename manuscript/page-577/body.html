       Is proudly marching by,
   The eagle of the mountain screams
       From out his stormy sky;
   Who speaketh to the precipice,
       And to the chasm sheer;
   Who hovers o'er the thrones of kings,
       And bids the caitiffs fear.
   King of the peak and glacier,
       King of the cold, white scalps—
   He lifts his head, at that close tread,
       The eagle of the Alps.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   O shame! those men that march below—
       O ignominy</blockquote></div> </div>
