   To seek their Lady, who herself awakes
   Rosy as morn, just when the morning breaks;
   Half-dreaming still, she ponders, can it be
   Some mystic change has passed, for her to see
   One old man in the place of two quite young!
   Her wondering eyes search carefully and long.
   It may be she regrets the change: meanwhile,
   The valiant knight salutes her with a smile,
   And then approaching her with friendly mien,
   Says, "Madam, has your sleep all pleasant been?"</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   MRS. NEWTON CROSLAND.</p></blockquote><p>THE SOUDAN, THE SPHINXES, THE CUP, THE LAMP.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
