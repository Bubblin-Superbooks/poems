<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   George, Jeanne, sing on! George, Jeanne, unconscious play!
         Your father's form recall,
   Now darkened by his sombre shade, now gilt
         By beams that wandering fall.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Oh, knowledge! what thy use? did we not know
         Death holds no more the dead;
   But Heaven, where, hand in hand, angel and star
         Smile at the grave we dread?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   A Heaven, which childhood represents on earth.
         Orphans, may God be nigh!
   That God, who can your bright steps turn aside
         From darkness, where I sigh.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   All joy be yours, though sorrow bows me down!
         To each his fitting wage:
   Children, I've passed life's span, and men are plagued
         By shadows at that stage.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
