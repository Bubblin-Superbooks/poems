<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">waterspouts; and winds that shake
   As 'twere a tree its ripened fruit to take.
   The winds grow wearied, warring with the tower,
   The noisy North is out of breath, nor power
   Has any blast old Corbus to defeat,
   It still has strength their onslaughts worst to meet.
   Thus, spite of briers and thistles, the old tower
   Remains triumphant through the darkest hour;
   Superb as pontiff, in the forest shown,
   Its rows of battlements make triple crown;
   At eve, its silhouette is finely traced
   Immense and blackâ€”showing the Keep is placed
   On rocky throne, sublime and high; east, west,
   And north and south, at corners four, there rest
   Four mounts; Aptar, where flourishes the pine,
   And Toxis, where the elms grow green and fine;
   Crobius and Bleyda, giants in their might,
   Against the stormy winds to stand and fight,
   And these above its diadem uphold
   Night's living canopy of clouds unrolled.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
