   Whilst the crushed shell upon the pebbly shore
       Crackled beneath the crocodile's huge coil.
   Westwards, like tiger's skin, each separate isle
   Spotted the surface of the yellow Nile;
       Gray obelisks shot upwards from the soil.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The star-king set. The sea, it seemed to hold
   In the calm mirror this live globe of gold,
       This world, the soul and torchbearer of our own.
   In the red sky, and in the purple streak,
   Like friendly kings who would each other seek,
       Two meeting suns were shown.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   "Shall I not stop?" exclaimed the impatient cloud.
