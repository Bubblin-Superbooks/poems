</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {January, 1871.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   In later years, they'll tell you grandpapa
     Adored his little darlings; for them did
   His utmost just to pleasure them and mar
     No moments with a frown or growl amid
   Their rosy rompings; that he loved them so
     (Though men have called him bitter, cold, and stern,)
   That in the famous winter when the snow
     Covered poor Paris, he went, old and worn,
   To buy them dolls, despite the falling shells,
   At which laughed Punch, and they, and shook his bells.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
