   Strange sights and gruesome met the breaking morn:
   Mute were the bugles, while the men bestrode
   Steeds turned to marble, unheeding the goad.
   The shells and bullets came down with the snow
   As though the heavens hated these poor troops below.
   Surprised at trembling, though it was with cold,
   Who ne'er had trembled out of fear, the veterans bold
   Marched stern; to grizzled moustache hoarfrost clung
   'Neath banners that in leaden masses hung.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   It snowed, went snowing still. And chill the breeze
   Whistled upon the glassy endless seas,
   Where naked feet on, on for ever went,
   With naught to eat, and not a sheltering tent.
   They were not living troops as seen in war,
   But merely phantoms of a dream, afar
   In darkness</blockquote></div> </div>
