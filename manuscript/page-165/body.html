</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XXII., September, 1828.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Oh! were I the leaf that the wind of the West,
     His course through the forest uncaring;
   To sleep on the gale or the wave's placid breast
     In a pendulous cradle is bearing.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   All fresh with the morn's balmy kiss would I haste,
     As the dewdrops upon me were glancing;
   When Aurora sets out on the roseate waste,
     And round her the breezes are dancing.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
