     The wind is off shore blowing;
   You only change your prison dull
     For one that's splendid, glowing!
   His Highness doats on milky cheeks,
     So do not make us dally"—
   We, eighty strong, who send along
     The dreaded Pirate Galley.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   She sought to flee back to her cell,
     And called us each a devil!
   We dare do aught becomes Old Scratch,
     But like a treatment civil,
   So, spite of buffet, prayers, and calls—
     Too late her friends to rally—
   We, eighty strong, bore her along
     Unto the Pirate Galley.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
