   Its step funereal lingers like the swing
   Of passing bell—'tis death, or else the king.
   'Tis he, the man by whom men live and die;
   But could one look beyond that phantom eye,
   As by the wall he leans a little space,
   And see what shadows fill his soul's dark place,
   Not the fair child, the waters clear, the flowers
   Golden with sunset—not the birds, the bowers—
   No; 'neath that eye, those fatal brows that keep
   The fathomless brain, like ocean, dark and deep,
   There, as in moving mirage, should one find
   A fleet of ships that go before the wind:
   On the foamed wave, and 'neath the starlight pale,
   The strain and rattle of a fleet in sail,
   And through the fog an isle on her white rock
   Hearkening from far the thunder's coming shock.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Still by the water's edge doth silent stand
