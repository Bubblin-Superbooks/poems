   'Twas a poor statue underneath a mass
   Of leafless branches, with a blackened back
   And a green foot—an isolated Faun
   In old deserted park, who, bending forward,
   Half-merged himself in the entangled boughs,
   Half in his marble settings. He was there,
   Pensive, and bound to earth; and, as all things
   Devoid of movement, he was there—forgotten.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code></blockquote></div> </div>
