   In peace beneath their trees! Dost thou not know,
   Poet, that ever it is impious deemed,
   In desert spots where drowsy shades repose—
   Though love itself might prompt thee—to shake down
   The moss that hangs from ruined centuries,
   And, with the vain noise of throe ill-timed words,
   To mar the recollections of the dead?"</p></blockquote><blockquote><pre><code> Then to the gardens all enwrapped in mist</code></pre>
<p>   I hurried, dreaming of the vanished days,
   And still behind me—hieroglyph obscure
   Of antique alphabet—the lonely Faun
   Held to his laughter, through the falling night.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code></blockquote></div> </div>
