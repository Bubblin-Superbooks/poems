<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   What can I do? Shall I read books,
   Or write more verse—or turn fond looks
   Upon enamels blue, sea-green,
   And white—on insects rare as seen
   Upon my Dresden china ware?
   Or shall I touch the globe, and care
   To make the heavens turn upon
   Its axis? No, not one—not one
   Of all these things care I to do;
   All wearies me—I think of you.
   In truth with you my sunshine fled,
   And gayety with your light tread—
   Glad noise that set me dreaming still.
   'Twas my delight to watch your will,
   And mark you point with finger-tips
     To help your spelling out a word;
   To see the pearls between your lips
     When I your joyous laughter heard;
   Your honest brows that looked so true,
     And said "Oh, yes!" to each intent;
   Your great bright eyes, that loved to view
     With admiration innocent
   My fine old S�vres; the eager thought
   That every kind of knowledge sought;
   The elbow push with "Come and see!"</p></blockquote></div> </div>
