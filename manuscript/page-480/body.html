<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Quite recently unto her Court have come
   Two men—unknown their names or native home,
   Their rank or race; but one plays well the lute,
   The other is a troubadour; both suit
   The taste of Mahaud, when on summer eve,
   'Neath opened windows, they obtain her leave
   To sing upon the terrace, and relate
   The charming tales that do with music mate.
   In August the Moravians have their f�te,
   But it is radiant June in which Lusace
   Must consecrate her noble Margrave race.
   Thus in the weird and old ancestral tower
   For Mahaud now has come the fateful hour,
   The lonely supper which her state decrees.
   What matters this to flowers, and birds, and trees,
   And clouds and fountains? That the people may
   Still bear their yoke—have kings to rule alway?
   The water flows, the wind in passing by
   In murmuring tones takes up the questioning cry.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
