<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">XI.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The palm-tree that grows on the rock to this day,
   Feels its leaf growing yellow, its slight stem decay,
       In the blasting and ponderous air;
   These towns are no more! but to mirror their past,
   O'er their embers a cold lake spread far and spread fast,
       With smoke like a furnace, lies there!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   J.N. FAZAKERLEY</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
