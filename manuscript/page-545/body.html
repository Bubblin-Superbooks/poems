   The waters of Nagain, sands of Sahara warm,
     The Atlas and the Caucasus, snow-capped and lone,
   Mecca, Marcatta, these were massed in part to form
     A portion of the giant shadow of Zim's throne.
   Before his might, to theirs, as hardest rock to dust,
     There have recoiled a horde of savage, warlike chiefs,
   Who have been into Afric's fiery furnace thrustâ€”
     Its scorching heat to his rage greatest of reliefs.
   There is no being but fears Zim; to him bows down
     Even the sainted Llama in the holy place;
   And the wild Kasburder chieftain at his dark power
     Turns pale, and seeks a foeman of some lesser race.
   Cities and states are bought and sold by Soudan Zim,
     Whose simple word their thousand people hold as law.
   He ruins them at will, for what are men to him,
     More than to stabled cattle is the sheaf of straw?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
