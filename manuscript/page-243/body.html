 Of tarantella danced 'neath Tuscan tower,
 Listening, he while away the evening hour;
 Or wake the echoes, mournful, lone and deep,
 Of that sad city, in its dreaming bower
 By the volcano seized, where mansions keep</code></pre>

 While as the swarthy boatman at his side
 Chants Tasso's lays to Virgil's pleased shade,
 Ever he sees, throughout that circuit wide,
 From shaded nook or sunny lawn espied,
 From rocky headland viewed, or flow'ry shore,
 From sea, and spreading mead alike descried,
