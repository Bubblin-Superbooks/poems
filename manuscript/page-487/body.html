<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">make the sight less terrible.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Each monstrous horse a frontal horn doth bear,
   If e'er the Prince of Darkness herdsman were,
   These cattle black were his by surest right,
   Like things but seen in horrid dreams of night.
   The steeds are swathed in trappings manifold,
   The armed knights are grave, and stern, and cold,
   Terrific too; the clench'd fists seem to hold
   Some frightful missive, which the phantom hands
   Would show, if opened out at hell's commands.
   The dusk exaggerates their giant size,
   The shade is awedâ€”the pillars coldly rise.
   Oh, Night! why are these awful warriors here?</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Horses and horsemen that make gazers fear
   Are only empty armor. But erect
   And haughty mien they all affect
