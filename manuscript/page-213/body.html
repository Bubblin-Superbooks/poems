<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">sweetest flowers their balmy perfumes yield
       When breathed upon by thee,
   Of forest, where thy voice like zephyr plays,
   And morn pours out its flood of golden rays,
       When thy sweet smile I see.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Oh, sweetest eyes, like founts of liquid blue;
   And little hands that evil never knew,
       Pure as the new-formed snow;
   Thy feet are still unstained by this world's mire,
   Thy golden locks like aureole of fire
       Circle thy cherub brow!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Dove of our ark, thine angel spirit flies
   On azure wings forth from thy beaming eyes.
       Though weak thine infant feet,
   What strange amaze this new and strange world gives
   To thy sweet virgin soul, that spotless lives
       In virgin body sweet.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
