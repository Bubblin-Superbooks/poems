</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XIII.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   A Lion in his jaws caught up a child—
   Not harming it—and to the woodland, wild
   With secret streams and lairs, bore off his prey—
   The beast, as one might cull a bud in May.
   It was a rosy boy, a king's own pride,
   A ten-year lad, with bright eyes shining wide,
   And save this son his majesty beside
   Had but one girl, two years of age, and so
   The monarch suffered, being old, much woe;
   His heir the monster's prey, while the whole land
   In dread both of the beast and king did stand;
   Sore terrified were all.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
