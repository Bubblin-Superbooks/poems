   Whilst, as from vial full, thy spare-naught wrath
       Splashes this trembling race:
   These are thy grass as thou their trenchant scythes
   Cleaving their neck as 'twere a willow withe—
       Their blood none can efface.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "But ends thy tether! for Janina makes
   A grave for thee where every turret quakes,
       And thou shalt drop below
   To where the spirits, to a tree enchained,
   Will clutch thee, there to be 'mid them retained
       For all to-come in woe!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
