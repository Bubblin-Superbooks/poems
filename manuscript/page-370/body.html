<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">I went my way; but yet—in saddened spirit</code></pre>
<p>   Pondering on all that had my vision crossed,
   Leaves of old summers, fair ones of old time—
   Through all, at distance, would my fancy see,
   In the woods, statues; shadows in the past!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
