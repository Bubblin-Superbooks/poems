     Slept Boaz 'neath the leaves. Now it betided,
     Heaven's gate being partly open, that there glided
   A fair dream forth, and hovered o'er his sleep.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   And in his dream to heaven, the blue and broad,
     Right from his loins an oak tree grew amain.
     His race ran up it far, like a long chain;
   Below it sung a king, above it died a God.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
