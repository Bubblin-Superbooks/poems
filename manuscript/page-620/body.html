   Ah! when I see you, child, and when I hear
   You sing, or try, with low voice whispering near,
   And touch of fingers soft, my grief to cheer,
   I dream this darkness, where the tempests groan,
   Trembles, and passes with half-uttered moan.
   For though these hundred towers of Paris bend,
   Though close as foundering ship her glory's end,
   Though rocks the universe, which we defend;
   Still to great cannon on our ramparts piled,
   God sends His blessing by a little child.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   MARWOOD TUCKER.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
