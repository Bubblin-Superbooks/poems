     Alas! their right to joy is plain.
   If they are hungry, Paradise
     Weeps, and if cold, Heaven thrills with pain.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The want that saps their sinless flower
     Speaks judgment on Sin's ministers.
   Man holds an angel in his power.
     Ah! deep in Heaven what thunder stirs.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   When God seeks out these tender things,
     Whom in the shadow where we keep,
   He sends them clothed about with wings,
     And finds them ragged babes that weep!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Dublin University Magazine.</em>
