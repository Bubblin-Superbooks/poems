<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">wandering, amid the vapor dim,—
   A mystery; of shadows a procession grim,
   Nearing a blackening sky, unto its rim.
   Frightful, since boundless, solitude behold
   Where only Nemesis wove, mute and cold,
   A net all snowy with its soft meshes dense,
   A shroud of magnitude for host immense;
   Till every one felt as if left alone
   In a wide wilderness where no light shone,
   To die, with pity none, and none to see
   That from this mournful realm none should get free.
   Their foes the frozen North and Czar—That, worst.
   Cannon were broken up in haste accurst
   To burn the frames and make the pale fire high,
   Where those lay down who never woke or woke to die.
   Sad and commingled, groups that blindly fled
   Were swallowed smoothly by the desert dread.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   'Neath folds of blankness, monuments were raised
