   Where lurks the good invisible
   Amid the depths of discord's sea—
   That seem, alas! so dark to me!
   Oppressive to a mighty state,
   Contentions, feuds, the people's hate—
   But who dare question that which fate
       Has ordered to have been?
   Haply the earthquake may unfold
   The resting-place of purest gold,
   And haply surges up have rolled
       The pearls that were unseen!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   G.W.M. REYNOLDS.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
