       From him could I require,
   The pain of absence to assuage—
   A vassal-maid can have no page,
       A liegeman has no squire.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   This day will witness, with the duke's,
       My cymbaleer's return:
   Gladness and pride beam in my looks,
   Delay my heart impatient brooks,
       All meaner thoughts I spurn.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Back from the battlefield elate
       His banner brings each peer;
   Come, let us see, at the ancient gate,
   The martial triumph pass in state—
       With the princes my cymbaleer.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
