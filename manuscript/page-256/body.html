</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {V. ii., August, 1832.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Sire, beware, the future's range
     Is of God alone the power,
   Naught below but augurs change,
     E'en with ev'ry passing hour.
   Future! mighty mystery!
   All the earthly goods that be,
   Fortune, glory, war's renown,
   King or kaiser's sparkling crown,
   Victory! with her burning wings,
   Proud ambition's covetings,—
     These may our grasp no more detain
   Than the free bird who doth alight
   Upon our roof, and takes its flight
     High into air again.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
