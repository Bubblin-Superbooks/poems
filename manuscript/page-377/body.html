<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">tyrant wrenched ye peace,
   Can you be dazed by tinselled crime,
     And spy no wolf beneath the fleece?
   Build palaces where Fortunes feast,
   And bear your loads like well-trained beast,
   Though once such masters you made flee!
         But then, like me, you ate
         Food of a blessed <em>f�te_—
   The bread of _Liberty</em>!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   H.L.W.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
