     In the region of the sun
   I dwell, where in a rich array
   The clouds encircle the king of day,
     His radiant journey done.
   My wings, pure golden, of radiant sheen
     (Painted as amorous poet's strain),
   Glimmer at night, when meadows green
     Sparkle with the perfumed rain
     While the sun's gone to come again.
   And clear my hand, as stream that flows;
     And sweet my breath as air of May;
     And o'er my ivory shoulders stray
     Locks of sunshine;â€”tunes still play
   From my odorous lips of rose.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
