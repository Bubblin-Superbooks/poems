   Fair Mahaud mused—then said, "Be silent now;
   You seem to watch me; little 'tis I know,
   Only that from Bohemia Joss doth come,
   And that in Poland Zeno hath his home.
   But you amuse me; I am rich, you poor—
   What boon shall I confer and make secure?
   What gift? ask of me, poets, what you will
   And I will grant it—promise to fulfil."
   "A kiss," said Joss.
                       "A kiss!" and anger fraught
   Amazed at minstrel having such a thought—
   While flush of indignation warmed her cheek.
   "You do forget to whom it is you speak,"
   She cried.
             "Had I not known your high degree,
   Should I have asked this royal boon," said he,
   "Obtained or given, a kiss must ever be.
   No gift like king's—no kiss like that of queen!"
   Queen! And on Mahaud's face a smile was seen.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
