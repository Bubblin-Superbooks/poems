</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {XXIII., July, 1836.}</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   What do I dream of? Far from the low roof,
   Where now ye are, children, I dream of you;
   Of your young heads that are the hope and crown
   Of my full summer, ripening to its fall.
   Branches whose shadow grows along my wall,
   Sweet souls scarce open to the breath of day,
   Still dazzled with the brightness of your dawn.
   I dream of those two little ones at play,
   Making the threshold vocal with their cries,
   Half tears, half laughter, mingled sport and strife,
   Like two flowers knocked together by the wind.
