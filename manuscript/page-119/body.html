   Black ants, like a pall!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To escape is in vain
   From this horrible rain!
     Alas! all things die;
   In the lightning's red flash
   The bridges all crash;
   'Neath the tiles the flame creeps;
   From the fire-struck steeps
   Falls on the pavements below,
   All lurid in glow,
     Rolling down from on high!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   Beneath every spark,
     The red, tyrannous fire
   Mounts up in the dark
     Ever redder and higher;
