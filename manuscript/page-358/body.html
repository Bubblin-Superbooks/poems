   Our rows of roses, by urchins' haste,
     Are destroyed where they leap the barrier o'er.
   The fount is walled in where, at noonday pride,
     She so gayly drank, from the wood descending;
   In her fairy hand was transformed the tide,
     And it turned to pearls through her fingers wending</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The wild, rugged path is paved with spars,
     Where erst in the sand her footsteps were traced,
   When so small were the prints that the surface mars,
     That they seemed <em>to smile</em> ere by mine effaced.
   The bank on the side of the road, day by day,
     Where of old she awaited my loved approach,
   Is now become the traveller's way
     To avoid the track of the thundering coach.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
