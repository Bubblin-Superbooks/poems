<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">You'd have no roses but those grown
     Above some buried corse.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Am I not pinioned firmly?
     Why be angered if the door
   Repulses fifty suing maids
     Who vainly there implore?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Let them live onâ€”to envy
     My own empress of the world,
   To whom all Stamboul like a dog
     Lies at the slippers curled.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   To you my heroes lower
     Those scarred ensigns none have cowed;
   To you their turbans are depressed
     That elsewhere march so proud.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
