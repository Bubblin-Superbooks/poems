     Since I my pallid face between your hands have laid,
   Since I have known your soul, and all the bloom of it,
     And all the perfume rare, now buried in the shade;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Since it was given to me to hear one happy while,
     The words wherein your heart spoke all its mysteries,
   Since I have seen you weep, and since I have seen you smile,
     Your lips upon my lips, and your gaze upon my eyes;</p></blockquote></div> </div>
