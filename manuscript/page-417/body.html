<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">The messages of love that mortals write,
   Filled with intoxication of delight,
   Written in April, and before the Maytime
   Shredded and flown, playthings for the winds' playtime.
   We dream that all white butterflies above,
   Who seek through clouds or waters souls to love,
   And leave their lady mistress to despair,
   To flirt with flowers, as tender and more fair,
   Are but torn love-letters, that through the skies
   Flutter, and float, and change to Butterflies.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   A. LANG.</p></blockquote><p>HAVE YOU NOTHING TO SAY FOR YOURSELF?</p><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
