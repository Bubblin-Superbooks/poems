       The heralds on white steeds;
   Armorial pride decks their attire,

       Famed for heroic deeds.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Feared by the Paynim's dark divan,
       The Templars next advance;
   Then the tall halberds of Lausanne,
   Foremost to stand in battle van
       Against the foes of France.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Now hail the duke, with radiant brow,
       Girt with his cavaliers;
   Round his triumphant banner bow
   Those of his foe. Look, sisters, now!
       Here come the cymbaleers!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
