<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">have not their joints more strong
   Than are the joinings of these legs; the long
   Scaled gauntlet fingers look like worms that shine,
   And battle robes to shroud-like folds incline.
   The heads are skull-like, and the stony feet
   Seem for the charnel house but only meet.
   The pikes have death's-heads carved, and seem to be
   Too heavy; but the shapes defiantly
   Sit proudly in the saddleâ€”and perforce
   The rider looks united to the horse!
   The network of their mail doth clearly cross.
   The Marquis' mortar beams near Ducal wreath,
   And on the helm and gleaming shield beneath
   Alternate triple pearls with leaves displayed
   Of parsley, and the royal robes are made
   So large that with the knightly harness they
   Seem to o'ermaster palfreys every way.
   To Rome the oldest armor might be traced,
   And men and horses' armor interlaced
   Blent horribly; the man and steed we feel
   Made but one hydra with its scales of steel.
