</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {IX., September, 1825.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   List to me, O Madelaine!
   Now the snows have left the plain,
       Which they warmly cloaked.
   Come into the forest groves,
   Where the notes that Echo loves
       Are from horns evoked.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Come! where Springtide, Madelaine,
   Brings a sultry breath from Spain,
     Giving buds their hue;
   And, last night, to glad your eye,
   Laid the floral marquetry,
     Red and gold and blue.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
