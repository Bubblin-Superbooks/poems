</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Bk. III. xi., July, 1853.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   O paths whereon wild grasses wave!
     O valleys! hillsides! forests hoar!
   Why are ye silent as the grave?
     For One, who came, and comes no more!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Why is thy window closed of late?
     And why thy garden in its sear?
   O house! where doth thy master wait?
     I only know he is not here.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Good dog! thou watchest; yet no hand
     Will feed thee. In the house is none.
   Whom weepest thou? child! My father. And
     O wife! whom weepest thou? The Gone.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
