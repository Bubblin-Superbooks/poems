 And served each one with what was e'er prepared
 By him, who in a sombre vault below,
 Peppered the royal pig with peoples' woe,
 And grimly glad went laboring till lateâ€”
 The morose alchemist we know as Fate!
 That ev'ry guest might learn to suit his taste,
 Behind had Conscience, real or mock'ry, placed;
 Conscience a guide who every evil spies,
 But royal nurses early pluck out both his eyes!</code></pre></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code> Oh! at the table there be all the great,
