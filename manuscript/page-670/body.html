<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Roman's triumph graced,
     The little Romans all;
   We boys hung on the procession's flanks,
   Seeking some father in thy ranks,
     And loud thy praise did call.
   Who that surveyed thee, when that day
   Thou deemed that future glory ray
     Would here be ever bright;
   Feared that, ere long, all France thy grave
   From pettifoggers vain would crave
     Beneath that column's height?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   <em>Author of "Critical Essays."</em>
