<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   I love on mossy couch to sing
     A Spanish roundelay,
   And see my sweet companions
     Around commingling gay,—
   A roving band, light-hearted,
     In frolicsome array,—
   Who 'neath the screening parasols
     Dance down the merry day.
   But more than all enchanting
     At night, it is to me,
   To sit, where winds are sighing,
     Lone, musing by the sea;
   And, on its surface gazing,
     To mark the moon so fair,
   Her silver fan outspreading,
     In trembling radiance there.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   W.D., <em>Tait's Edin. Magazine</em>
