<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">Heaven's clear pearl polluted with earth's clay!
   The sin is yours—with your accursed gold—
     Man's wealth is master—woman's soul the slave!
   Some purest water still the mire may hold.
     Is there no hope for her—no power to save?
   Yea, once again to draw up from the clay
     The fallen raindrop, till it shine above,
   Or save a fallen soul, needs but one ray
     Of Heaven's sunshine, or of human love.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   W.C.K. WILDE.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
