   Grown old upon the heights of Appenzel,
   When morning freshness breathes round all the wood,
   So Eviradnus now before them stood,
   Opening his visor, which at once revealed
   The snowy beard it had so well concealed.
   Thin Sigismond was still as dog at gaze,
   But Ladislï¿½us leaped, and howl did raise,
   And laughed and gnashed his teeth, till, like a cloud
   That sudden bursts, his rage was all avowed.
   "'Tis but an old man after all!" he cried.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
