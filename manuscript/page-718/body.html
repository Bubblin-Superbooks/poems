<p>   My lord, it is no reason for long life
   That we are young! Alas! I have seen too oft
   The old clamped firm to life, the young torn thence;
   And the lids close as sudden o'er their eyes
   As gravestones sealing up the sepulchre.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   G. MOIR.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
