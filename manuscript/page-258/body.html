<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   To-morrow! 'tis the foaming war-horse falling;
   To-morrow! thy victorious march appalling,
     'Tis the red fires from Moscow's tow'rs that wave;
   'Tis thine Old Guard strewing the Belgian plain;
   'Tis the lone island in th' Atlantic main:
     To-morrow! 'tis the grave!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Into capitals subdued
     Thou mayst ride with gallant rein,
   Cut the knots of civil feud
     With the trenchant steel in twain;
   With thine edicts barricade
   Haughty Thames' o'er-freighted trade;
   Fickle Victory's self enthrall,
   Captive to thy trumpet call;
   Burst the stoutest gates asunder;
   Leave the names of brightest wonder,
     Pale and dim, behind thee far;
   And to exhaustless armies yield
   Thy glancing spur,â€”o'er Europe's field
     A glory-guiding star.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
