     Lahore laid in lilies, Golconda, Cashmere;
   And Ispahan, dear to the pilgrim's sight,
     And Bagdad, whose towers to heaven uprear;
     Alep, that pours on the startled ear,
   From its restless masts the gathering roar,
   As of ocean hamm'ring at night on the shore.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Mysore is a queen on her stately throne,
     Thy white domes, Medina, gleam on the eye,—
       Thy radiant kiosques with their arrowy spires,
       Shooting afar their golden fires
         Into the flashing sky,—
   Like a forest of spears that startle the gaze
   Of the enemy with the vivid blaze.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
