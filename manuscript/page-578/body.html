   Are the sons of my free mountains
       Sold for imperial hire.
   Ah! the vilest in the dungeon!
       Ah! the slave upon the seasâ€”
   Is great, is pure, is glorious,
       Is grand compared with these,
   Who, born amid my holy rocks,
       In solemn places high,
   Where the tall pines bend like rushes
       When the storm goes sweeping by;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Yet give the strength of foot they learned
       By perilous path and flood,
   And from their blue-eyed mothers won,
       The old, mysterious blood;
   The daring that the good south wind
       Into their nostrils blew,
   And the proud swelling of the heart
       With each pure breath they drew;
   The graces of the mountain glens,
       With flowers in summer gay;
   And all the glories of the hills
       To earn a lackey's pay.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
