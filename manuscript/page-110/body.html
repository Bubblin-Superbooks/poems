   And hide their basements from the curious eye.
       Mountains—with waves of ashes covered o'er!
   In graduated blocks of six feet square

       Their ever heightening monstrous steps they bore.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   No scorching blast could daunt the sleepless ken
   Of roseate Sphinx, and god of marble green,
       Which stood as guardians o'er the sacred ground.
   For a great port steered vessels huge and fleet,
   A giant city bathed her marble feet
