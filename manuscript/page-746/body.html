<p>   O' th' Romans, chosen king, crowned emperor,
   Heaven's sword-bearer, monarch of Burgundy
   And Arlesâ€”the tomb of Karl I dared profane,
   But have repented me on bended knees
   In penance 'midst the desert twenty years;
   My drink the rain, the rocky herbs my food,
   Myself a ghost the shepherds fled before,
   And the world named me as among the dead.
   But I have heard my country</blockquote></div> </div>
