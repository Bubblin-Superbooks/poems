</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {X., May, 1839.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   As in some stagnant pool by forest-side,
   In human souls two things are oft descried;
   The sky,—which tints the surface of the pool
   With all its rays, and all its shadows cool;
   The basin next,—where gloomy, dark and deep,
   Through slime and mud black reptiles vaguely creep.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   R.F. HODGSON</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
