<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Mercy! Allah! have pity! oh, spare!
       See! I cling to your knees repenting!
   Kind brothers, forgive me! for mercy, forbear!
   Be appeased at the cry of a sister's despair,
       For our mother's sake relenting.
   O God! must I die? They are deaf to my cries!
       Their sister's life-blood shedding;
   They have stabbed me each one—I faint—o'er my eyes
       A <em>veil of Death</em> is spreading!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   THE BROTHERS.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Gulnara, farewell! take <em>that</em> veil; 'tis the gift
   Of thy brothers—a veil thou wilt never lift!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   "FATHER PROUT" (FRANK S. MAHONY).</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
