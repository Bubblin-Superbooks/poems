   Whiter than marble their ripe lips beneath,
   And bushy hair fresh and more brown
   Than mossy walls at old gates of a town,
   Calling to one another with loud cries
   For younger imps to be in at the prize;
   Stealing without concern but tremulous with fear
   They glance around lest Doll the maid appear;—
   Their jolly lips—that haply cause some pain,
   And all those busy fingers, pressing now and 'gain,
   The teeming udders whose small, thousand pores
   Gush out the nectar 'mid their laughing roars,
   While she, good mother, gives and gives in heaps,
   And never moves. Anon there creeps
   A vague soft shiver o'er the hide unmarred,
   As sharp they pull, she seems of stone most hard.
   Dreamy of large eye, seeks she no release,
   And shrinks not while there's one still to appease.
     Thus Nature—refuge 'gainst the slings of fate!
   Mother of all, indulgent as she's great!
   Lets us, the hungered of each age</blockquote></div> </div>
