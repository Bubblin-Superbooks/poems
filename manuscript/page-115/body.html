   Up to the clouds seemed scaling, stage by stage,
   Noiseless their streets; their sleeping inmates lie,
   Their gods, their chariots, in obscurity!
   Like sisters sleeping 'neath the same moonlight,
   O'er their twin towers crept the shades of night,
   Whilst scarce distinguished in the black profound,
   Stairs, aqueducts, great pillars, gleamed around,
   And ruined capitals: then was seen a group
   Of granite elephants 'neath a dome to stoop,
   Shapeless, giant forms to view arise,
   Monsters around, the spawn of hideous ties!
