</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   {Bk. IV. xiii., Jersey, November, 1852.}</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   While in the jolly tavern, the bandits gayly drink,
   Upon the haunted highway, sharp hoof-beats loudly clink?
   Yea; past scant-buried victims, hard-spurring sturdy steed,
   A mute and grisly rider is trampling grass and weed,
   And by the black-sealed warrant which in his grasp shines clear,
   I known it is _the Future_â€”God's Justicer is here!</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
