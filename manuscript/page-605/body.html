   Strong-arm and prophet-heart had all but come
   To win the city, and to make it "Rome."
   Calm, of the antique grandeur, ripe to be
   Named with the noblest of her history.
   He would have Romanized your Rome—controlled
   Her glory, lordships, Gods, in a new mould.
   Her spirits' fervor would have melted in
   The hundred cities with her; made a twin
   Vesuvius and the Capitol; and blended
   Strong Juvenal's with the soul, tender and splendid,
   Of Dante—smelted old with new alloy—
   Stormed at the Titans' road full of bold joy
   Whereby men storm Olympus. Italy,
   Weep!—This man could have made one Rome of thee!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   VI.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
